# Project: LogoCraft Azure Static Web App

**Status**: Active
**Started**: 2024-06-01
**Target Completion**: TBD
**Repository**: [GitHub URL when available]
**Live Demo**: [Azure Static Web App URL when deployed]

## Project Overview

### Objective
Building a React-based logo creation and image processing web application hosted on Azure Static Web Apps with integrated Azure Functions backend and Blob Storage for image management.

### Problem Solved
Create a full-stack web application demonstrating Azure cloud services integration, image processing capabilities, and modern web development practices for portfolio and learning purposes.

### Target Users
- Portfolio demonstration for cloud development skills
- Logo creation tool for small businesses
- Learning exercise for Azure services integration

## Technology Stack
**Frontend**: React with Vite build system
**Backend**: Azure Functions (Node.js) integrated with Static Web App
**Storage**: Azure Blob Storage (uploads private, downloads public)
**Hosting**: Azure Static Web Apps (Standard SKU)
**Monitoring**: Azure Application Insights
**CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with Azure integration

## Architecture Components

### Azure Resources
1. **Resource Group**: Container for all project resources
2. **Storage Account**: Image storage with dual containers
   - `uploads`: Private access via SAS tokens
   - `downloads`: Public blob access for results
3. **Static Web App**: Frontend hosting with integrated functions
4. **Application Insights**: Monitoring and troubleshooting

### Authentication Strategy
- **GitHub OIDC**: Secure deployment using federated credentials
- **SAS Tokens**: Time-limited, scoped storage access
- **Environment Variables**: Secure configuration via Static Web App settings
