# Project: Mobile-First Wordle Clone

**Status**: Planning
**Started**: 2024-11-01
**Target Completion**: TBD
**Repository**: [GitHub URL when created]
**Live Demo**: [URL when deployed]

## Project Overview

### Objective
Building a Wordle clone as a full-stack web application using modern web development practices with Azure cloud infrastructure to ensure scalability, security, and maintainability.

### Problem Solved
Create a functional word-guessing game that demonstrates full-stack development skills, cloud deployment knowledge, and modern web development practices for portfolio purposes.

### Target Users
