For handling a coding project with large amounts of code and multiple drafts within Obsidian, I'd recommend the following approach:

1. Project Structure:
   - Create a main project note in "6 - Full Notes" folder.
   - Use this as an index for your project, linking to other relevant notes.

2. Code Storage:
   - For large code blocks, consider using Obsidian's "Code block" feature with language specification for syntax highlighting.
   - For very large chunks of code or entire files, store them externally (e.g., in a GitHub repository) and link to them from your notes.

3. Version Control:
   - Use a separate version control system like Git for your actual code.
   - In Obsidian, create notes for different versions/drafts, linking to the corresponding commits or branches in your external repository.

4. Draft Management:
   - Create separate notes for each significant draft or version.
   - Use a naming convention like "ProjectName_Draft_v1", "ProjectName_Draft_v2", etc.
   - Link these drafts from your main project note.

5. Code Snippets:
   - For important code snippets you want to reference directly in your notes, use code blocks within your Obsidian notes.

6. Documentation:
   - Create separate notes for different aspects of your project (e.g., setup instructions, API documentation, architecture overview).
   - Link these from your main project note.

7. Tagging:
   - Use tags like [[project-name]], [[draft]], [[final-version]] to categorize different notes related to your project.

8. Obsidian Plugins:
   - Consider using plugins like "Obsidian Git" for version control of your notes themselves.

Example structure in your main project note:

```markdown
# Audio Processing and Silence Detection Project

## Project Overview
[Brief description]

## Current Version
- [[AudioProcessing_CurrentVersion]]
- [Link to GitHub repo]

## Drafts
- [[AudioProcessing_Draft_v1]]
- [[AudioProcessing_Draft_v2]]
- [[AudioProcessing_Draft_v3]]

## Documentation
- [[AudioProcessing_Setup]]
- [[AudioProcessing_API]]
- [[AudioProcessing_Architecture]]

## Key Components
- [[DirectML for PyTorch]]
- [[Pydub Audio Library]]
- [[Python Concurrent Futures]]

## TODO
- [List of pending tasks]

Tags: [[Python]] [[Audio]] [[project-audio-processing]]
```

This structure keeps your project organized within Obsidian while allowing for proper code management externally. It provides a central hub for your project within Obsidian, linking to all relevant information and versions.
