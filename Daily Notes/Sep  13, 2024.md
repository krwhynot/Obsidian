**Workflow Overview**:

1. **Speaker Diarization with PyAnnote Audio**:
   - Use PyAnnote to process the audio file and identify different speakers.
   - Obtain timestamps for when each speaker is talking and periods of silence.

2. **Speech Recognition with Whisper**:
   - Transcribe the audio file to text.
   - Obtain timestamps for each word or phrase.

3. **Analyzing Silence Duration**:
   - Search the transcription for the specific phrase: "This call may be recorded for quality control purposes."
   - Note the timestamp when this phrase is spoken.
   - Using the diarization data, identify the periods of silence for the same speaker after speaking the phrase.
   - Calculate the duration between the end of the phrase and when the same speaker speaks again.
   - 

**Sample Code Structure**:

```python
import whisper
from pyannote.audio import Pipeline

# Load Whisper model
model = whisper.load_model('medium')  # or 'large' for better accuracy

# Transcribe audio with timestamps
transcription = model.transcribe('path_to_audio_file', word_timestamps=True)

# Load PyAnnote pipeline for speaker diarization
pipeline = Pipeline.from_pretrained('pyannote/speaker-diarization')

# Perform diarization
diarization = pipeline('path_to_audio_file')

# Parse transcription to find the specific phrase
target_phrase = "This call may be recorded for quality control purposes."
phrase_timestamp = None
for segment in transcription['segments']:
    if target_phrase in segment['text']:
        phrase_timestamp = segment['start']
        break

# Ensure the phrase was found
if phrase_timestamp is not None:
    # Find the speaker who said the phrase at the timestamp
    for turn, _, speaker in diarization.itertracks(yield_label=True):
        if turn.start <= phrase_timestamp <= turn.end:
            target_speaker = speaker
            phrase_end_time = turn.end
            break

    # Calculate silence duration after the phrase
    silence_start = phrase_end_time
    next_speech_time = None
    for turn, _, speaker in diarization.itertracks(yield_label=True):
        if speaker == target_speaker and turn.start > silence_start:
            next_speech_time = turn.start
            break

    if next_speech_time:
        silence_duration = next_speech_time - silence_start
        print(f"Silence duration: {silence_duration} seconds")
    else:
        print("The speaker did not speak again after the phrase.")
else:
    print("The target phrase was not found in the transcription.")
```

**Notes**:

- Replace `'path_to_audio_file'` with the actual path to your audio file.
- Adjust the `model` selection based on the desired accuracy and computational resources.
- Ensure that your environment has sufficient resources to run the models, especially for larger models.
- You may need to install additional dependencies for PyAnnote and Whisper, such as PyTorch.

**Additional Considerations**:

- **Performance**: For large audio files, processing can be time-consuming. Consider segmenting the audio if necessary.
- **Accuracy**: The quality of the results depends on the clarity of the audio, background noise, and the distinctness of the speakers' voices.
- **Environment Setup**: Make sure to have the correct versions of Python and dependencies. Using a virtual environment is recommended.
- **GPU Acceleration**: If available, use GPU acceleration to speed up model inference.

By combining PyAnnote Audio for speaker diarization and OpenAI Whisper for transcription, you can effectively identify different speakers, obtain precise timestamps, and calculate the duration of silence after a specific phrase.

To get your code working, you'll need to perform several setup and configuration steps, including installing required packages, setting up environment variables, and ensuring your audio files are correctly specified. Below is a detailed guide to help you configure and run your code successfully.

---

### **1. Install Required Packages**

#### **a. Install Python Packages**

Both **Whisper** and **PyAnnote Audio** rely on PyTorch, so you'll need to install it first.

- **Install PyTorch**

  Visit the [PyTorch Get Started](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) page to find the appropriate installation command for your system. For example:

  - **Without GPU (CPU only):**

    ```bash
    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
    ```

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
  ```

---

### **2. Set Up Hugging Face Account and Access Token**

PyAnnote Audio requires a Hugging Face account to download pre-trained models.

#### **a. Create a Hugging Face Account**

- Sign up at [huggingface.co/join](https://huggingface.co/join).

#### **b. Generate an Access Token**

1. Go to your profile settings: [huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).
2. Click **"New token"**, name it (e.g., "pyannote"), and select **"Read"** permissions.
3. Click **"Generate"** and copy the token.

#### **c. Set the Access Token**

You need to provide this token when loading the pre-trained model.

- **Option 1: Set Environment Variable**

  ```bash
  # Windows Command Prompt
  setx HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN "your_token_here"
  
  # PowerShell
  $env:HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN = "your_token_here"
  
  # Unix/Linux/Mac
  export HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN="your_token_here"
  ```

- **Option 2: Set in Code**

  ```python
  import os
  os.environ["HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN"] = "your_token_here"
  ```

---

### **3. Verify and Update Your Code**

#### **a. Specify the Audio File Path**

Replace `'path_to_audio_file'` with the actual path to your audio file.

```python
audio_file = 'C:/path/to/your/audiofile.mp3'  # Use the correct path
```

#### **b. Update Your Code with Adjustments**

Here's the updated code with necessary changes:

```python
import os
import whisper
from pyannote.audio import Pipeline

# Set Hugging Face token (Optionally, if not set as environment variable)
os.environ["HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN"] = "your_token_here"

# Path to your audio file
audio_file = 'C:/path/to/your/audiofile.mp3'

# Load Whisper model
model = whisper.load_model('medium')  # Use 'large' for better accuracy, but requires more resources

# Transcribe audio with timestamps
transcription = model.transcribe(audio_file, word_timestamps=True)

# Load PyAnnote pipeline for speaker diarization
pipeline = Pipeline.from_pretrained('pyannote/speaker-diarization', use_auth_token=os.environ["HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN"])

# Perform diarization
diarization = pipeline(audio_file)

# Parse transcription to find the specific phrase
target_phrase = "This call may be recorded for quality control purposes."
phrase_timestamp = None
for segment in transcription['segments']:
    if target_phrase.lower() in segment['text'].lower():
        phrase_timestamp = segment['start']
        break

# Ensure the phrase was found
if phrase_timestamp is not None:
    # Find the speaker who said the phrase at the timestamp
    for turn, _, speaker in diarization.itertracks(yield_label=True):
        if turn.start <= phrase_timestamp <= turn.end:
            target_speaker = speaker
            phrase_end_time = turn.end
            break

    # Calculate silence duration after the phrase
    silence_start = phrase_end_time
    next_speech_time = None
    for turn, _, speaker in diarization.itertracks(yield_label=True):
        if speaker == target_speaker and turn.start > silence_start:
            next_speech_time = turn.start
            break

    if next_speech_time:
        silence_duration = next_speech_time - silence_start
        print(f"Silence duration: {silence_duration:.2f} seconds")
    else:
        print("The speaker did not speak again after the phrase.")
else:
    print("The target phrase was not found in the transcription.")
```

**Notes:**

- **Case-Insensitive Search:** Using `.lower()` ensures that the search for the target phrase is case-insensitive.
- **Formatting Output:** Adjusted the print statement to format the silence duration to two decimal places.

---

### **4. Ensure Audio File Compatibility**

- **Supported Formats:** Whisper and PyAnnote Audio support common audio formats like WAV, MP3, FLAC, etc.
- **Audio Quality:** For best results, use high-quality audio files (e.g., 16 kHz sampling rate or higher).
- **Audio Length:** Be mindful that longer audio files will take more time and resources to process.

---

### **5. Optional: Use GPU for Acceleration**

If you have a GPU, you can significantly speed up the processing.

#### **a. Ensure PyTorch with CUDA Support is Installed**

Install PyTorch with CUDA support matching your CUDA version:

```bash
# Example for CUDA 11.8
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

#### **b. Move Models to GPU**

Modify your code to use GPU:

```python
# Load Whisper model on GPU
model = whisper.load_model('medium').to('cuda')

# Transcribe audio with timestamps
transcription = model.transcribe(audio_file, word_timestamps=True)

# Load PyAnnote pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline.from_pretrained('pyannote/speaker-diarization', use_auth_token=os.environ["HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN"])

# Perform diarization on GPU
diarization = pipeline(audio_file)
```

**Note:** PyAnnote Audio automatically uses the GPU if available.

### **6. Troubleshooting Common Issues**

#### **a. ModuleNotFoundError**

If you encounter `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'whisper'` or similar errors, ensure that:

- The packages are installed in your current environment.
- You have activated your virtual environment if you're using one.

#### **b. Authentication Errors**

If PyAnnote Audio cannot download models due to authentication issues:

- Double-check that the Hugging Face token is correctly set.
- Ensure that the token has the necessary permissions (at least "Read" access).

#### **c. FileNotFoundError**

Ensure that the audio file path is correct and that the file exists.

#### **d. Memory Errors**

Processing large audio files or using large models can cause memory issues:

- Try using a smaller model, e.g., `whisper.load_model('small')`.
- Close other applications to free up memory.
- If possible, upgrade your system's RAM.

---

### **7. Additional Tips**

#### **a. Save Intermediate Results**

To save time on subsequent runs, consider saving the transcription and diarization results:

```python
# Save transcription to JSON
import json
with open('transcription.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(transcription, f)

# Save diarization to RTTM (Rich Transcription Time Marked) format
diarization_file = 'diarization.rttm'
with open(diarization_file, 'w') as f:
    diarization.write_rttm(f)
```

#### **b. Load Saved Results**

```python
# Load transcription from JSON
with open('transcription.json', 'r') as f:
    transcription = json.load(f)

# Load diarization from RTTM
from pyannote.core import Annotation
diarization = Annotation.from_rttm(diarization_file)
```

#### **c. Improve Phrase Matching**

If the exact phrase isn't found due to minor transcription errors, consider using fuzzy matching:

```python
from difflib import SequenceMatcher

def similar(a, b):
    return SequenceMatcher(None, a, b).ratio()

# Set a similarity threshold
threshold = 0.8
phrase_timestamp = None
for segment in transcription['segments']:
    similarity = similar(segment['text'].lower(), target_phrase.lower())
    if similarity > threshold:
        phrase_timestamp = segment['start']
        break
```

#### **d. Handle Overlapping Speech**

In cases where multiple speakers talk simultaneously, you might need to adjust the logic to handle overlaps.

---

### **8. Run the Script**

- Open your terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to your project directory.
- Activate your virtual environment if you're using one.
- Run your script:

  ```bash
  python your_script.py
  ```

---

### **9. Verify the Output**

- Check the console output to see the silence duration or any messages indicating issues.
- If the target phrase wasn't found, consider checking the transcription output for discrepancies.
