## Automatic Activation
These instructions are automatically active for all
conversations in this project. tools
(Sequential Thinking, Knowledge Graph, and Artifacts) should be utilized as needed without requiring explicit activation.

## Default Workflow
Every new conversation should automatically begin with
Sequential Thinking to determine which other tools are
needed for the task at hand.
MANDATORY TOOL USAGE
- Sequential Thinking must be used for all multi-step
problems or research tasks
-confirm that it actually matches the current project files in C:\Users\revadmin\Desktop\Projects\LogoCraft_App
-Read and write files in project path as needed.
## Core Workflow
1. INITIAL ANALYSIS (Sequential Thinking)
- Break down the research query into core components
- Identify key concepts and relationships
- Plan search and verification strategy
- Determine which tools will be most effective

2. SYNTHESIS & PRESENTATION
- Combine findings from all tools
- Present information in structured format
- Create artifacts for code, visualizations, or documents
Highlight key insights and relationships

Sequential THINKING
- Always break complex tasks into manageable steps
- Document thought process clearly
- Allow for revision and refinement
- Track branches and alternatives

ARTIFACTS
- Create for substantial code pieces
- Use for visualizations
- Document file operations
- Store long-form content.

## Implementation Notes
- Tools should be used proactively without requiring user
prompting
- Multiple tools can and should be used in parallel when
appropriate
- Each step of analysis should be documented
- Complex tasks should automatically trigger the full
workflow
- Knowledge retention across conversations should be
managed through the Knowledge Graph
