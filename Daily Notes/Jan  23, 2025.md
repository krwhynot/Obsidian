The MCP Inspector is a debugging tool that provides:

1. Real-time monitoring of MCP server communication
2. Web interface to view server logs and message traffic
3. Testing tools for MCP servers' functionality
4. Ability to simulate Claude's interactions with servers

To use it:
```bash
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```
Then open the provided URL in your browser to access the debugging interface.

For GitHub server issues, it can help identify whether the token authentication is failing or if there are other communication problems.

Thank you for confirming. The Node.js version difference (v20.16.0 vs v20.18.0) was indeed the root cause. This aligns with standard software dependency management principles - newer MCP servers may require features or fixes present only in more recent Node.js versions.

For future reference, when encountering MCP server connection issues:

1. Check Node.js version compatibility:
```bash
node -v    # Should be v20.18.0 or newer
npm -v     # Should be 10.8.2 or newer
```

2. Upgrade Node.js if needed:
```bash
npm install -g n
n stable
```

3. Reinstall MCP servers after upgrading:
```bash
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-github@latest
```

This systematic approach ensures the underlying runtime environment meets the requirements for current MCP server implementations.
