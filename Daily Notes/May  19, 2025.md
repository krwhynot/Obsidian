Create a Claude Prompt that asks me what is the goal or function of my coding project. After I share it then walk me through each component of the coding project by asking me multiple choice questions how I want to tackle each component. Do not create any actual code until you are at a level +9 out 10 in confidence with the full plan and have a detailed step by step guide for the project. You must know the following before coding anything:
PRE-CODING PROJECT CHECKLIST

SECTION 1: Problem & Goal Clarity
* Can I clearly describe the problem this project solves?
* Do I know who will use this (audience/stakeholders)?
* Is the project's main goal written down?
* Do I understand how success will be measured? (e.g., feature complete, user metrics, time saved)

SECTION 2: Feature & Scope Definition
* Have I listed the core features?
* Have I defined optional/future features?
* Have I sketched out the basic user flow or wireframe?
* Do I understand which features are MVP (Minimum Viable Product)?
* Have I written basic use cases or user stories?
  Example: “As a user, I want to delete a task so I can keep my list clean.”

SECTION 3: Tech Stack & Tooling Decisions
* What programming language(s) will I use and why?
* What frameworks or libraries will I use? (e.g., React, Flask, Django, Express)
* What data storage method will I use? (e.g., local file, SQLite, Firebase, PostgreSQL)
* What development tools do I need?
  * Code editor (e.g., VS Code)
  * Version control (Git)
  * Linter/formatter (Prettier, Black, ESLint)
* Have I picked a deployment target? (if needed: Heroku, Vercel, GitHub Pages)

SECTION 4: Architecture & File Structure Planning
* Do I have a rough idea of how to organize files?
  * UI / frontend
  * Logic / services
  * Data / config
* Have I mapped out how modules/functions will interact?
* Is there a need for layers like Controllers, Services, Models (MVC or similar)?
* Will I follow a design pattern or architectural principle? (e.g., DDD, clean architecture)

SECTION 5: Data & Input Requirements
* What kind of data does my app need to collect or process?
* What format will the data come in? (JSON, CSV, form input)
* Do I need to validate or sanitize input data?
* Do I need mock data for testing?
* How will I store, retrieve, and update the data?

SECTION 6: Security, Privacy & Access (if relevant)
* Do I need to handle user authentication or sessions?
* Is my code and/or API access controlled?

SECTION 7: Development & Workflow Setup
* Is my development environment ready to go?
  * Local project folder created
  * Virtual environment (for Python)
  * Dev server works
* Is version control set up? (git init, .gitignore)

SECTION 8: Deployment or Distribution (if applicable)
* Where will the app be deployed?
* What is the deploy process? (manual steps or CI/CD)
* Do I need a domain name or hosting setup?
* Have I tested it in the live/production environment?
* Will I need to update it later? How will I push changes?
