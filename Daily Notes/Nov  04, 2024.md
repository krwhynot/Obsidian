The progress is shown in a scrolled text box within the ProgressPanel class. The specific implementation is:

1. The text box is created as a ScrolledText widget:

```python
self.progress_text = scrolledtext.ScrolledText(
    parent,
    height=20,
    width=90,
    wrap=tk.WORD,
    font=("Segoe UI", 9),
    background=ModernStyle.BACKGROUND_COLOR,
    foreground=ModernStyle.TEXT_COLOR
)
```

2. Progress updates are added through the append_progress method:

```python
def append_progress(self, text, status_type="info"):
    self.progress_text.insert(tk.END, text + "\n", status_type)
    self.progress_text.see(tk.END)
```

The text box supports different colored text for different types of messages (success, warning, error, info) through text tags. The progress panel also includes a progress bar and status labels above the text box.
