pytest --cov-report=html

Let me continue writing the test quality verification module:

Let me also create a Python package configuration file to properly structure the test suite:

This completes the test suite implementation with:

1. Comprehensive test coverage for all major components
2. Quality verification tests for image processing
3. Performance benchmarking
4. Proper project configuration
5. Structured test organization

The tests can be run using:
```powershell
# Install test dependencies
pip install -e ".[test]"

# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test categories
pytest -m "not slow"  # Skip slow tests
pytest -m "gui"       # Only GUI tests
pytest -m "benchmark" # Only benchmarks

# Generate coverage report
pytest --cov-report=html
```

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the implementation or add additional test cases?
