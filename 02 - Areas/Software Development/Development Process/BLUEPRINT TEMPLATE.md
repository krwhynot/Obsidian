## 6. Data Structures and Storage

- **Domain Entities:** _What are the key objects in your system?_
- **Entity Relationships:** _How do these entities relate to each other?_
- **Data Structures:** _What's the most efficient way to represent this data?_
- **Storage Mechanisms:** _How will data persist between sessions?_
- **Data Volume and Access Patterns:** _How will design choices scale with usage?_

## 7. Error Handling and Edge Cases

- **Potential Failure Points:** _Where might things go wrong?_
- **Recovery Mechanisms:** _How will the system respond to failures?_
- **Fallback Strategies:** _What alternatives exist when primary approaches fail?_
- **Logging and Monitoring Plan:** _How will you track errors?_
- **User Feedback Mechanisms:** _How will users know what went wrong?_

## 8. Validation and Testing Strategy

- **Test Approach:** _What types of testing will you need?_
- **Key Test Scenarios:** _What must be verified for success?_
- **Validation Strategy:** _How will you ensure requirements are met?_
- **Test Automation Plan:** _What can be automated?_
- **Quality Metrics:** _How will you measure success?_

## 9. Technical Specifications

- **Interface Contracts:** _What are the APIs between components?_
- **Performance Requirements:** _What speed, scale, or capacity is needed?_
- **Technical Environment Constraints:** _What environment limitations exist?_
- **Coding Standards:** _What style guidelines will be followed?_
- **Documentation Requirements:** _What must be documented and how?_

## 10. Implementation Plan

- **Work Sequence:** _What should be built first?_
- **Implementation Dependencies:** _What must be completed before other work can begin?_
- **Resource Allocation:** _Who will do what?_
- **Project Milestones:** _What are key checkpoints for measuring progress?_
- **Release Strategy:** _How will the software reach users?_
