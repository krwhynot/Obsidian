You would use **server-memory** (such as OpenMemory MCP Server or similar memory MCP servers) when you want your AI tools or assistants to have persistent, structured, and shareable memory across sessions, projects, and even different MCP-compatible applications

- Remembering project requirements and decisions across coding, debugging, and planning tools
    
- Storing and retrieving personal or team notes, instructions, or preferences
    
- Maintaining context for customer support bots, AI tutors, or development assistants
    
- Building AI workflows that require persistent knowledge and context handoff between tools
