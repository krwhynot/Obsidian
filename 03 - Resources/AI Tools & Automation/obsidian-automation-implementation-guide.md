- [ ] Update workflow templates with automation features
- [ ] Train on new automated workflows

## Post-Implementation Verification

### Efficiency Measurement (After 1 Month)
- [ ] Measure new daily maintenance time (target: 2 minutes)
- [ ] Count automated vs manual linking activities
- [ ] Assess inbox processing automation rate
- [ ] Document time savings and efficiency gains

### Quality Assessment
- [ ] Review linking accuracy and relevance
- [ ] Check template compliance rate
- [ ] Verify knowledge connection growth
- [ ] Assess overall system health

### User Experience Evaluation
- [ ] Evaluate workflow disruption during transition
- [ ] Identify areas for further optimization
- [ ] Document lessons learned
- [ ] Plan next iteration of improvements

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Auto Note Mover Problems
**Issue**: Notes not moving to correct folders
**Solutions**:
- Check tag spelling and consistency
- Verify folder paths are correct
- Review pattern matching rules
- Test with simple cases first

### Templater Issues
**Issue**: Templates not applying correctly
**Solutions**:
- Verify template syntax
- Check folder permissions
- Test with basic templates first
- Review Templater documentation

### Linking Problems
**Issue**: Too many or irrelevant automatic links
**Solutions**:
- Adjust Automatic Linker sensitivity
- Refine pattern matching rules
- Use exclude lists for common words
- Manual review and cleanup

### Performance Issues
**Issue**: Vault becomes slow with automation
**Solutions**:
- Disable unused plugins
- Optimize Dataview queries
- Reduce automation frequency
- Review plugin conflicts

## Rollback Procedures

### If Automation Causes Problems
1. **Immediate**: Disable problematic plugins
2. **Assessment**: Identify specific issues
3. **Selective Restore**: Re-enable working plugins only
4. **Gradual Reintroduction**: Add plugins one at a time
5. **Alternative Approach**: Consider different plugin combinations

### Data Recovery
- Use backup created in pre-implementation phase
- Restore specific folders if needed
- Rebuild automation rules incrementally
- Document what went wrong for future reference
