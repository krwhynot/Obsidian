# Summary of Transcription Methods by System Specification

## Recommended Methods by System

### Higher-Spec System (i7-10610U, 16GB RAM)

1. **Transcription**: Faster-Whisper with medium model (float16 precision)
2. **Silence Detection**: Silero VAD (full capability)
3. **Text Analysis**: spaCy + lightweight Hugging Face models
4. **Audio Quality**: pyAudioAnalysis (comprehensive metrics)
5. **Processing Approach**: Full files or large chunks (60s)

### Lower-Spec System (1 CPU core, 512MB RAM)

1. **Transcription**: Faster-Whisper with tiny model (int8 quantization)
2. **Silence Detection**: Basic librosa RMS-based detection
3. **Text Analysis**: TextBlob only (ultra-lightweight)
4. **Audio Quality**: Simplified metrics with librosa
5. **Processing Approach**: Very small chunks (30s) with memory cleanup

## Methods We're NOT Using

1. **WhisperNER**: Too resource-intensive for both systems
2. **PyAnnote Diarization**: Too heavy for lower-spec system
3. **Transformer-based NLP**: Full models are too heavy
4. **Chunked Processing with Overlap**: Only simplified chunking for low-spec
5. **WhisperX**: Good option but more complex than needed
6. **GPU Acceleration**: Neither system has CUDA support

This approach ensures that both systems can process audio files while addressing all your requirements, though the higher-spec system will provide better quality results and process files much faster.

write files only in R:\Projects\Python\CHAT_APP\test_processing * create code to determine the specs of the computer to determine which methods to use * then after it has been determine then use recommend methods to transcribe the audio R:\Projects\Python\CHAT_APP\temp\E8zqcj.mp3 Again only write code that will be in R:\Projects\Python\CHAT_APP\test_processing
