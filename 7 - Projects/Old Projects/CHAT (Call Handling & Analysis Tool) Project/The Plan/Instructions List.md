# CHAT Project Development Instructions - Current Status

## Completed Components

Our instructions currently cover several crucial aspects of the CHAT (Call Handling & Analysis Tool) project:

### Core Architecture and Foundation

We have detailed instructions for the fundamental architecture, including the layered design approach and directory structure. The instructions explain how different components interact within the system, using clear analogies and practical examples to aid understanding.

### Queue Management System

We have provided comprehensive implementation details for the queue management system, including database schema design, error handling integration, and retry mechanisms. The instructions cover both the technical implementation and the reasoning behind design decisions.

### Audio Processing Component

The instructions detail the audio processing system's implementation, including integration with the Whisper API, silence detection, and keyword tracking. We've included specific code examples and explanations of key processing methods.

### GUI Implementation

We have covered the main window implementation, processing thread management, and user interface components. The instructions explain how to create a responsive interface that maintains user feedback during long-running operations.

### Error Handling Framework

The instructions include a robust error handling and recovery system, integrated with both the queue management system and the user interface. This includes error categorization, recovery strategies, and user notification systems.
