# LogoCraft Project Development Instructions

## Project Overview
[Brief description of the project, its primary purpose, and core functionality]
- Primary Purpose:
	- Provide a **user-friendly Python GUI** for converting a single, restaurant's logo into multiple file types and dimensions.
- Core Features:
	1.  Graphical User Interface(GUI):
		- Allows users to browse for the source logo file and select desired output formats and sizes. 
	2. Automated Image Resizing
		- Resize the source logo into different dimensions: **300×300**, **136×136**, **140×112**, **155×110**, **256×256**.
		- Maintains aspect ratio and overall image quality. 
	3. Format Conversion
		- Converts the source logo in PNG and BMP formats, including specialized BMP formats (256 color only)
		- Ensures color accuracy and minimal distortion.
		- Ensures each generated logo maintains aspect ratio and visual clarity
	4. Batch Processing:
		- Option to generate all require images in one click or selectively create only certain formats. 
	5.   File Organization & Naming: 
		- Automatically names files using consistent naming conventions(e.g., `Logo_300x300.png`, `PRINTLOGO_256x256.bmp`).
	3. Documentation & Handover
		-Includes a built-in “Help” or “About” section within the GUI that explains usage.
		
- Target Platform:
	-Desktop App: using Python and PyQt6, compatible with Windows
## Core Architecture Principles

The LogoCraft application follows the **Model-View-Presenter (MVP)** architectural pattern to ensure maintainability, testability, and future extensibility. This architecture divides the application into three distinct layers:

#### Architectural Approach
The system uses a modular MVP architecture with the following components:

**View Layer(GUI)**
The View consists of a single main window implementing these core features:
	- File input area supporting both browse and drag-drop functionality
	- Format selection through checkboxes with an "Select All" option
	- Clear process initiation button
	- Progress indication area(eg. showing what files have been created.)
	- Status messages display

**Presenter Layer (Application Logic)**
The Presenter serves as an intermediary that:
	- Coordinates user interactions from the View
	- Validates input files and selected options
	- Manages the processing workflow
	- Updates the View with status and progress information
	- Handles error conditions and user feedback 

**Model Layer (Business Logic)**
The Model contains the core image processing logic:
	- Image format conversion algorithms
	- Size transformation calculations
	- File Handling operations
	- Naming convention management

 **Directory Structure**
```

│   └── main.py         # Application entry point
└── tests/              # Test files matching src/ structure
```

**Extension Points**
The architecture supports future expansion through:
1. Additional Feature Modules:
	- New Features (like SQL database integration) can be added as separate modules
	- Each module can have its own MVP components
	- Shared utilities and configurations can be reused
2. Interface Adaptation:
	- The View layer can be replaced with a web interface while keeping the same Presenters and Models.
	- Multiple interface types can coexist using the same business logic
3. Processing Pipelines:
	- New image formats can be added by extending the Model layer
	- Additional processing options can be integrated without modifying existing code
	- Batch processing capabilities can be added while maintaining the same architecture
	

### Configuration Management

#### Environment Management
The application maintains minimal persistent state while providing necessary sageguards for file operations. Core environment configurations include:

**Directory Management**
- The application stores the last used input and output directory paths in a local configuration file
- Directory paths are validated on application startup 
- If no output directory is selected when processing begins, the application prompts for directory selection
- Invalid or inaccessible paths are automatically cleared from storage

**Processing Parameters**
-Input Format: 
	- Accepted formats: JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, SVG, PSD, WebP
	- Minimum resolution validation occurs before processing 
	- For transparent images, white background is applied for BMP conversion

**Output Specifications**
The following output configurations are hardcoded and not user-modifiable:
1. Standard Logo Variaionts:
```python
LOGO_CONFIGS = {
    'Logo.png': {
        'size': (300, 300),
        'format': 'PNG'
    },
    'Smalllogo.png': {
        'size': (136, 136),
        'format': 'PNG'
    },
    'KDlogo.png': {
        'size': (140, 112),
        'format': 'PNG'
    },
    'RPTlogo.bmp': {
        'size': (155, 110),
        'format': 'BMP'
    },
    'PRINTLOGO.bmp': {
        'size': (256, 256),
        'format': 'BMP',
        'color_depth': 8,
        'paper_width_mm': 79.5
    }
}
```

2. Processing Rules: 
	- All outputs variations are generated in the same directory
	- File overwrite protection with user confirmation
	- Automatic centering calculating for PRINTLOGO.bmp based on 80 paper width
	- High contrast optimization for thermal printing (PRINTLOGO.bmp only)

**Operation Logging**
The application maintains a processing log with the following info:
	- Successfully created files
	- Creation timestamp for each file
	- Processing errors or warnings
	- Overwrite confirmations

#### **File Management Settings**

**Input Validation**
- Resolution check against largest required output (300X300)
- File format validation against supported input types
- File accessibility verification before processing starts

**Output Management**
- Automate file naming based on predefined patterns
- Overwrite protection with user confirmation dialog
- Success logging with timestamp for each generated file 

#### **Default Application State**

**Initial UI State**
- All output format checkboxes selected by default
- Last used directory paths populated if available
- Clear status display area for processing results

**Session Management**
- No persistent user preferences between sessions
- Directory paths preserved between sessions
- Processing logs maintained for current session only 

This configuration structure provides a balance between ease of use and processing reliability while maintaining the specific output requirements for each file type.

### Core Interfaces
# Core Interfaces

The LogoCraft application implements four primary interfaces that handle distinct responsibilities while maintaining a simple, synchronous workflow.

## IFileHandler Interface

This interface manages all file system operations:

```python
class IFileHandler:
    def validate_input_file(self, file_path: str) -> bool:
        """
        Validates input file format and accessibility.
        
        Args:
            file_path: Path to the input image file
            
        Returns:
            bool: True if file is valid and accessible
        
        Raises:
            InvalidFileError: If file format is not supported
            FileAccessError: If file cannot be accessed
        """
        pass

    def ensure_output_directory(self, directory_path: str) -> bool:
        """
        Verifies output directory exists and is writable.
        Creates directory if it doesn't exist.
        
        Args:
            directory_path: Target directory path
            
        Returns:
            bool: True if directory is ready for writing
        """
        pass

    def check_file_exists(self, file_path: str) -> bool:
        """
        Checks if output file already exists.
        
        Args:
            file_path: Path to check
            
        Returns:
            bool: True if file exists
        """
        pass
```

## IImageProcessor Interface

Handles all image transformation operations:

```python
class IImageProcessor:
    def process_image(self, input_path: str, output_path: str, 
                     format_config: dict) -> bool:
        """
        Processes single image according to format configuration.
        
        Args:
            input_path: Source image path
            output_path: Destination path
            format_config: Dictionary containing size and format specifications
            
        Returns:
            bool: True if processing succeeds
            
        Raises:
            ImageProcessingError: If processing fails
        """
        pass

    def validate_image_dimensions(self, image_path: str) -> bool:
        """
        Checks if image meets minimum resolution requirements.
        
        Args:
            image_path: Path to image file
            
        Returns:
            bool: True if image dimensions are sufficient
        """
        pass
```

## IUserInterface Interface

Manages all user interaction and display:

```python
class IUserInterface:
    def update_status(self, message: str) -> None:
        """
        Updates status display with processing information.
        
        Args:
            message: Status message to display
        """
        pass

    def show_error_dialog(self, error_message: str) -> None:
        """
        Displays error message in popup dialog.
        
        Args:
            error_message: Error description to show user
        """
        pass

    def confirm_overwrite(self, file_path: str) -> bool:
        """
        Prompts user for file overwrite confirmation.
        
        Args:
            file_path: Path of file to be overwritten
            
        Returns:
            bool: True if user confirms overwrite
        """
        pass
```

## ILogger Interface

Provides comprehensive logging for debugging:

```python
class ILogger:
    def log_operation(self, operation_type: str, details: dict) -> None:
        """
        Logs operation details for debugging.
        
        Args:
            operation_type: Type of operation (e.g., 'FILE_CREATED')
            details: Dictionary containing operation details
        """
        pass

    def log_error(self, error_type: str, error_details: dict) -> None:
        """
        Logs error information for debugging.
        
        Args:
            error_type: Category of error
            error_details: Dictionary containing error information
        """
        pass

    def get_operation_summary(self) -> list:
        """
        Retrieves list of successful operations.
        
        Returns:
            list: Successfully processed files with timestamps
        """
        pass
```

## Interface Implementation Guidelines

1. Error Handling:
   - All errors are logged through ILogger
   - User-facing errors are displayed via IUserInterface
   - Processing continues to next file if one file fails
   - No retry mechanisms implemented

2. Processing Flow:
   - Operations execute synchronously
   - Each format processed independently
   - Status updates provided for each completed operation
   - Simple success/failure reporting to user

3. Logging Strategy:
   - Detailed debug logging during development
   - Minimal success messages in production
   - Error details logged for troubleshooting
   - Operation timestamps recorded for tracking

4. User Interaction:
   - Error conditions shown in popup dialogs
   - Processing status displayed in main window
   - Overwrite confirmation required for existing files
   - No pause/cancel functionality implemented
