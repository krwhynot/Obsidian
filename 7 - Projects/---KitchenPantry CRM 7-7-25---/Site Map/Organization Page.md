UI Prompt
```
Act as a UI/UX market researcher. Your goal is to identify and deconstruct the most user-acclaimed and modern CRM interfaces for managing "Organizations" (or "Companies"). 

**Part 1: Identify the Design Leaders** 
First, identify 3-4 CRM platforms that are leaders in user-centric design. Do NOT include Salesforce, HubSpot, or Zoho unless a recent redesign is specifically and widely praised. 
Your selection criteria should be based on platforms that are: 
* Consistently rated highest for "Ease of Use" and "User Interface" on G2 and Capterra. 
* Featured in reputable tech or design publications for their innovative or user-friendly design. List your selected CRMs and provide a 1-2 sentence justification for each choice, citing the source of the acclaim (e.g., "High G2 rating for usability," "Praised by TechCrunch for its clean interface").

**Part 2: Deconstruct Their Design** For the CRMs you identified, perform a comparative analysis of the following, focusing on what makes them different or better than traditional CRMs: 

**A. The Organization List View:** 
* **Clarity & Scannability:** How do they achieve a clean, uncluttered view? Analyze their use of whitespace, typography, and layout (e.g., tables vs. cards vs. Kanban). 
* **"Quality of Life" Features:** What small but impactful features are present? (e.g., inline editing, customizable columns, intuitive hover actions). 
* **Aesthetics:** What visual choices create a modern and pleasing user experience? 

**B. The "Add New Organization" Form:** 
* **Simplicity & Efficiency:** How do they simplify data entry? Look for minimal designs, smart defaults, and clear calls-to-action. 
* **Guidance & Feedback:** Analyze how they handle required fields, validation errors, and success messages in a helpful, non-disruptive way. Conclude with a summary of the key UI/UX trends you observed that newer, highly-rated CRMs are adopting.
