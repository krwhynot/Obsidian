_Someone_ appreciates my over 5,000 cuts and pastes from the excel sheet into the CRM database….”let your fingers do the walking” is an old time AT&T landline phone saying ….but boy this is ridiculous!!

  

  

**News Flash!!**

Kaufhold's Kurds are now available thru Dot Foods and their items are accessible thru the Dot expressway. I have attached some photos.  Please remember this access is only to win NEW distributors like a Testa, Piazza, McFarling, Delco, SAS, RFD, Food and Paper and other regional distributors. Anthony will send us a list of Dot RM’s and their assigned regional distributor responsibilities later this week. Sample kits for new distributors are also available thru Dot.

  

We can grow this Kurd business by winning new flavors at the National Broadliners and gaining distribution of original into regional distributors. Dot access and our superior salesmanship will win the day! Let's entice street demand on the 100 targeted gastropubs, get the distributor rep on our side, complete 10 PIF's per item to build an offer that the distributor buyer can't refuse to stock!.
Attached link is now to be used for inputs and updates to field accounts. Complete inputs to all tabs relevant but certainly ‘operator’ and “contact”. "Opportunities" and "Interactions". This file is accessible thru Teams  MFB Channel or thru Sharepoint.

  

Kyle will be smoothing fonts and cross referencing and populating cells so we may see summaries by principal. 

  

The key deposit tabs were "operator" and "contact" as I copied from the Field Accounts excel spreadsheet into this format. Most of my work was bringing the POC information into the CRM sheet, so please focus on bringing in to the Notes of operator and contact tabs cells any call feedback, followup and progress notes.

Let me analyze this email and break down the key requirements for the CRM spreadsheet project.

Key Business Context:
