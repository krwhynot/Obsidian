  âŽ¿  Task 025: Settings Management Module - Phase-by-Phase Implementation

     Implementation Approach: Detailed Phase Approval

     Modified Strategy: Before starting each phase, I will:
     1. Enter plan mode
     2. Present detailed step-by-step actions for that specific phase  
     3. Show exact files to be created/modified with code snippets
     4. Wait for your approval before executing any changes
     5. Complete the phase and update task_025.txt with progress
     6. Move to next phase with detailed planning

     Phase 1 Preview: Enhanced Database Schema & Model

     When you approve this overall plan, I will immediately present Phase 1 detailed steps including:

     Detailed Phase 1 Steps (for approval):

     1. Create migration file: database/migrations/2025_06_21_HHMMSS_enhance_system_settings_table.php
       - Add category, type, description, default_value columns
       - Add validation_rules, ui_component, is_public columns  
       - Add indexes for performance
       - Show exact SQL commands
     2. Enhance SystemSetting model: app/Models/SystemSetting.php
       - Add new fillable fields and casts
       - Implement type-based value casting methods
       - Add validation methods and scopes
       - Show exact code changes
     3. Update factory: database/factories/SystemSettingFactory.php
       - Add support for new fields and types
       - Include CRM-specific examples
       - Show exact factory methods
     4. Create/update tests: tests/Unit/Models/SystemSettingTest.php
       - Test new model methods and scopes
       - Test type casting functionality
       - Show exact test cases

     Files to be Created/Modified in Phase 1:

     - âœ¨ NEW: database/migrations/[timestamp]_enhance_system_settings_table.php
     - ðŸ”§ MODIFY: app/Models/SystemSetting.php (major enhancements)
     - ðŸ”§ MODIFY: database/factories/SystemSettingFactory.php (add new fields)
     - âœ¨ NEW: tests/Unit/Models/SystemSettingTest.php (comprehensive tests)

     Success Criteria for Each Phase

     Phase 1 Success Criteria:

     - âœ… Migration runs successfully and adds all new columns
     - âœ… SystemSetting model properly casts values based on type
     - âœ… Factory generates realistic CRM settings data
     - âœ… All model tests pass with new functionality
     - âœ… Change log updated in app/Models/README.md

     Benefits of Phase-by-Phase Approval

     âœ… Granular Control

     - Review each phase's implementation details before execution
     - Ability to modify approach based on specific requirements
     - Ensure each phase meets exact expectations

     âœ… Risk Mitigation

     - Catch potential issues early in each phase
     - Validate database changes before they're applied
     - Ensure code quality at each step

     âœ… Progress Tracking

     - Clear visibility into implementation progress
     - Ability to pause/resume at any phase boundary
     - Detailed documentation of what was completed

     âœ… Quality Assurance

     - Each phase includes comprehensive testing
     - Code review opportunity at each stage
     - Validation of business requirements

     Next Step

     When you approve this overall approach, I will immediately present the detailed Phase 1 implementation plan with:
     - Exact file contents to be created/modified
     - Specific database schema changes
     - Complete model enhancements with code examples
     - Comprehensive test coverage details
     - Success criteria and validation steps

     This ensures you have complete visibility and control over each implementation step while maintaining momentum toward the complete settings 
     management solution.
