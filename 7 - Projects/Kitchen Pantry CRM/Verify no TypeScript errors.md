 Final Validation Commands:

  # 1. Verify no TypeScript errors
  npm run typecheck

  # 2. Test build process
  npm run build

  # 3. Run tests
  npm run test

  # 4. Test component functionality at:
  # http://localhost:3000/test-components

  Environment Variables Fix for Persistence:

  # Update .env.local for permanent fix

## Security Vulnerability Detection

## NPM Security Auditing

The built-in `npm audit` command identifies known security vulnerabilities in your dependency tree, which represents a critical form of technical debt [14](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/commands/npm-audit/)[15](https://nikgrozev.com/2020/03/22/improve-your-typescript-with-static-analysis/). However, enhanced tools like `audit-ci` provide more sophisticated filtering and reporting capabilities for large projects [15](https://nikgrozev.com/2020/03/22/improve-your-typescript-with-static-analysis/).

bash

`npm audit                   # Basic vulnerability scan npm audit fix              # Automatic fix for non-breaking changes npx audit-ci               # Enhanced audit with better reporting`

## Secret and Credential Detection

Modern secret detection tools can identify accidentally committed credentials, API keys, and other sensitive information that represents significant security technical debt [16](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304853/)[17](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10664-021-10109-y). Tools like GitLeaks and TruffleHog can scan your entire repository history to identify exposed secrets that may have been inadvertently committed during development [16](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304853/).
