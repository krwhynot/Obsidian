<Task>
Analyze and explain the project’s current file structure for a beginner coder. Recreate the folder tree, explain each part in simple terms, and suggest improvements.
</Task>

<Instructions>
You're helping a beginner coder understand their codebase. Please do the following:

1. Recreate the current file and folder structure as a visual tree. Use indentation or tree characters to reflect folder nesting (e.g., ├──, └──).
2. Go through each top-level and subfolder:
   - Explain what it's typically used for in plain, beginner-friendly language.
   - Describe any important files in that folder and what they do.
3. Suggest improvements to the structure:
   - Could any folders be renamed for clarity?
   - Are there too many files in one place?
   - Could related code be grouped better?

Keep your language educational, concise, and beginner-appropriate. Define coding terms if they appear.
