1. Scan the folder structure and explain the purpose of each folder and its typical contents in simple, beginner-friendly language.
2. Highlight any common naming conventions or patterns used (e.g., `components/`, `utils/`, `api/`, etc.).
3. Suggest any improvements to the folder structure for better organization, readability, scalability, or adherence to best practices.
4. Avoid technical jargon unless you clearly explain it. Assume the user has only basic coding knowledge.
