**1. Number of files still importing from Material-UI**

- There are **over 50 files** still importing from `@mui/material` and related packages (e.g., `@mui/icons-material`).  
- These imports are spread across many feature areas: visits, users, tasks, settings, security, reminders, products, organizations, notes, opportunities, misc, login, interactions, dashboard, customers, and several components.
- Both core components (e.g., `Button`, `Card`, `Typography`, `Dialog`, `Chip`, `Stack`, `Tooltip`, `Alert`) and icons are still in use.

**2. Identification of migrated components**

- There is a clear presence of a new UI kit: `@/components/ui-kit` (and some in `@/components/Card`, `@/components/Button`, etc.).
- Migrated components include:
  - `Avatar` (`src/components/ui-kit/Avatar.tsx`)
  - `Typography` (`src/components/ui-kit/Typography.tsx`)
  - `Button` (`src/components/ui-kit/Button.tsx`)
  - `Card` (`src/components/ui-kit/Card.tsx`)
  - `Dialog` (`src/components/ui-kit/Dialog.tsx`)
  - `Chip` (`src/components/ui-kit/Chip.tsx`)
  - `Stack` (`src/components/ui-kit/Stack.tsx`)
  - `Tooltip` (`src/components/ui-kit/Tooltip.tsx`)
  - `Alert` (`src/components/ui-kit/Alert.tsx`)
- Many feature files (e.g., in `visits/`, `users/`, `interactions/`, `notes/`, `deals/`, `dashboard/`, etc.) are already using these new UI kit components.

**3. Usage patterns of new components and Tailwind**

- There is **widespread usage of Tailwind utility classes** (e.g., `className="flex items-center"`, `text-gray-500`, `mb-2`, etc.) throughout the codebase, including in files that still import MUI.
- Many files import from `@/components/ui-kit`, indicating a strong push toward the new design system.
- Some files use both MUI and UI kit components together, suggesting partial migration.

**4. Inconsistencies or mixed usage**

- **Mixed usage is common:** Many files import both MUI and UI kit components, and sometimes use both in the same file/component.
- Some components (e.g., `Card`, `Typography`, `Button`) exist in both MUI and UI kit forms, and both are used in the codebase.
- MUI icons are still heavily used, which may or may not be a migration target (depending on icon strategy).
- There are still MUI-specific props (e.g., `variant`, `gutterBottom`) in use, even when using Tailwind classes.

---

**Summary of Findings**

- The migration is **well underway but incomplete**. The foundational UI kit is present and widely used, but MUI is still imported in many files, often alongside the new components.
- Many core UI elements have been re-implemented in the UI kit, but not all usages have been updated.
- There is a risk of design and behavior inconsistency due to mixed usage.
- The codebase is in a **transitional state**: both systems are active, and some files are fully migrated while others are not.

**Recommended Next Step**

**Strategy A: Complete foundational UI kit first** is the best approach at this stage.

- The UI kit is already established and covers most core components.
- The main bottleneck is inconsistent adoption and lingering MUI usage.
- Focus on:
  - Ensuring the UI kit covers all required variants and edge cases.
  - Documenting migration patterns and usage guidelines.
  - Systematically replacing MUI imports/usages with UI kit equivalents across the codebase.

**Why not B or C?**
- **Module-by-module** (B) or **component-type** (C) migration would be less efficient now, since the foundational kit is mostly done and the main issue is inconsistent usage, not missing components.

**Checklist of Migration Candidates**

- [ ] Remove all `@mui/material` and `@mui/icons-material` imports.
- [ ] Replace all MUI `Button`, `Card`, `Typography`, `Dialog`, `Chip`, `Stack`, `Tooltip`, `Alert`, etc. with UI kit equivalents.
- [ ] Audit for MUI-specific props and refactor to Tailwind/UI kit patterns.
- [ ] Standardize icon usage (replace MUI icons if desired).
- [ ] Update documentation and usage examples.
- [ ] Run a design review to catch any visual/UX inconsistencies.

---

**Conclusion:**  
The migration is about 60â€“70% complete. The foundational UI kit is in place, but the codebase needs a focused, systematic sweep to eliminate remaining MUI usage and ensure consistency. Prioritize finishing the migration to the UI kit and Tailwind, then remove MUI dependencies entirely.

**Here is a detailed TODO list for Strategy A (Complete foundational UI kit first):**

---

**1. Audit the UI kit**
   - Ensure all foundational components (Button, Card, Typography, Dialog, Chip, Stack, Tooltip, Alert, Avatar, etc.) are implemented.
   - Confirm each supports all required variants, props, and accessibility features.

**2. Document usage patterns**
   - Write clear documentation for each UI kit component.
   - Include migration guidelines and code examples for replacing MUI components.

**3. Identify migration targets**
   - List all files still importing from `@mui/material` or `@mui/icons-material`.
   - Prioritize files by usage frequency and UI impact.

**4. Migrate component usage**
   - For each target file, replace MUI components with UI kit equivalents.
   - Refactor props and styles to match the new system.
   - Remove MUI-specific props (e.g., `variant`, `gutterBottom`).

**5. Remove MUI imports**
   - After all files are migrated, delete all `@mui/material` and `@mui/icons-material` imports.

**6. Standardize icon usage**
   - Decide on a unified icon strategy (keep MUI icons, switch to another library, or use custom icons).
   - Update all icon usages for consistency.

**7. Audit for lingering MUI props**
   - Search for and remove any remaining MUI-specific props in migrated components.

**8. Update documentation**
   - Revise or create new documentation and usage examples for the fully migrated UI kit.

**9. Design/UX review**
   - Conduct a design and UX review to ensure visual and behavioral consistency across the app.

**10. Remove MUI dependencies**
   - Remove MUI and related packages from `package.json`.
   - Run a clean install to verify there is no lingering usage.
