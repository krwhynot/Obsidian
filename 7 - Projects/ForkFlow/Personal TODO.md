**Reduce Overcrowded Folders:**  
   If any folder (like `components/` or `utils/`) has too many files, consider subfolders (e.g., `components/Button/`, `utils/date/`).

**Consistent Naming:**  
   Make sure folder and file names are clear and consistent. For example, use plural for folders with many items (`contacts/`), singular for singletons (`layout/`).

**Documentation:**  
   Keep documentation in one place if possible (maybe merge `doc/` and `docs/`).
