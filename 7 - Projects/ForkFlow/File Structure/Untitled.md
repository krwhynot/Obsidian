**What Each Folder Is For (Beginner-Friendly)**

- **ForkFlow-crm/**: This is your project’s main folder. Everything for your app lives here.

- **atomic-crm@0.0.2, claude_prompt.md, CLAUDE.md, deno.lock**:  
  These are project files. Some are for configuration, documentation, or package management.  
  - `.md` files are Markdown, used for notes or documentation.
  - `deno.lock` is for dependency management (like a list of packages your project uses).

- **doc/**:  
  Holds documentation for your project.  
  - `API_DOCUMENTATION.md`: Explains how your app’s API works.
  - `archive/`, `current/`, `developer/`, `error_list/`, `Images/`, `user/`: Subfolders for organizing docs, images, and user guides.

- **docs/**:  
  More documentation, often for APIs or developer info.

- **playwright-report/**:  
  Stores reports from Playwright, a tool for automated browser testing.

- **public/**:  
  Files that are publicly available when your app runs (like images, icons, and static HTML files).

- **scripts/**:  
  Small programs (scripts) to automate tasks, like deploying your app or renaming fields.

- **setupFiles/**:  
  Setup files for testing tools (like Jest).

- **src/**:  
  The main source code for your app.  
  - **@types/**: TypeScript type definitions (helps with code checking).
  - **activity/**: Code for activity logs or tracking.
  - **api/**: Code for talking to your backend or APIs.
  - **common/**: Shared code used in many places.
  - **companies/**, **contacts/**, **customers/**, **deals/**, **notes/**, **opportunities/**, **organizations/**, **products/**, **reminders/**, **sales/**, **security/**, **settings/**, **tags/**, **tasks/**, **users/**, **visits/**:  
    Each folder is for a specific feature or part of your app (e.g., managing companies, contacts, sales, etc.).
  - **components/**: Reusable UI pieces (like buttons, cards, dialogs).
  - **dashboard/**: Code for dashboard screens.
  - **hooks/**: Custom React hooks (special functions for sharing logic).
  - **interactions/**: Code for user interactions or workflows.
  - **layout/**: Layout components (like headers, footers, or page wrappers).
  - **lib/**: Libraries or utilities (like connecting to Supabase or setting up Tailwind).
  - **login/**: Code for login and authentication screens.
  - **misc/**: Miscellaneous code that doesn’t fit elsewhere.
  - **providers/**: Code for connecting to data sources or APIs.
  - **root/**: Main app entry point or root-level components.
  - **tests/**: Test files for checking your code works.
  - **utils/**: Utility/helper functions.

- **test-data/**:  
  Sample data for testing (like a CSV of contacts).

- **test-results/**:  
  Stores results from running tests.

- **tests/**:  
  More test code, organized by feature or helper type.

**Suggestions for Improvement**

1. **Group by Domain or Feature:**  
   You already do this well (e.g., `companies/`, `contacts/`, etc.). Keep related files together in these folders.

2. **Reduce Overcrowded Folders:**  
   If any folder (like `components/` or `utils/`) has too many files, consider subfolders (e.g., `components/Button/`, `utils/date/`).

3. **Consistent Naming:**  
   Make sure folder and file names are clear and consistent. For example, use plural for folders with many items (`contacts/`), singular for singletons (`layout/`).

4. **Documentation:**  
   Keep documentation in one place if possible (maybe merge `doc/` and `docs/`).

5. **Remove Unused Files:**  
   If you have old or unused files (like in `archive/`), consider moving them to a clearly named `archive/` or deleting them.

6. **Testing:**  
   Keep all tests in a single `tests/` folder, or put feature tests next to the code they test (e.g., `contacts/ContactCard.test.tsx`).

7. **Public Assets:**  
   Keep only static files (images, icons, etc.) in `public/`.

**Summary for Beginners**

- Each folder is like a “drawer” for a different part of your app.
- Keep things tidy by grouping related code together.
- Use clear names so you (and others) can find things easily.
- Don’t be afraid to reorganize as your app grows!
