User Experience: 
-When first viewing the page the user should see a logon box in the center of the page with Enter your username and password to Sign-in. Also a link that says "Forgot Password". There should be field boxes underneath to be able to enter the user's Username and Password then a button to click Sign In. 

If the username and password are valid then it will take the user to the Home Page with dashboards.

If the user forgot their password they should be able to click on the "Forgot Password" link. The user should then be able to enter their email in a text field and click a button to get an email sent to them to allow them to reset their password.
