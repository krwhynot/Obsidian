   - Resource limits

### Core Interfaces
Key system protocols:

1. [Interface 1] Protocol:
   - Primary responsibilities
   - Key methods
   - Error handling approach
   - Performance requirements

2. [Interface 2] Protocol:
   - Primary responsibilities
   - Key methods
   - Error handling approach
   - Performance requirements

### Data Models
Core data structures:
