You're absolutely right - let's create a comprehensive checklist before diving into the code. I'll break this down into clear, manageable phases with all the key considerations for each step.

# Phase 1: Project Setup & Planning
- [ ] Define project requirements
  - What data fields to collect for each restaurant
	- Restaurant name
	- Street address
	- Phone number
	- Website
	- Menu Link
  - How many restaurants to scrape
  - How often the data needs to be updated
- [ ] Choose development tools
  - Python environment setup
  - Required libraries (requests, BeautifulSoup, pandas)
  - Code editor or IDE
- [ ] Plan data storage
  - File format (CSV, Excel, database)
  - Data structure/schema
  - Backup strategy

# Phase 2: Yelp Data Analysis
- [ ] Study Yelp's structure
  - Identify URL patterns for poke restaurants
  - Analyze HTML structure of restaurant pages
  - Note any rate limiting or Terms of Service considerations
- [ ] Map out data locations
  - Restaurant name location in HTML
  - Address elements
  - Phone number format
  - Hours of operation
  - Reviews/ratings (if needed)
  - Price range
  - Menu link (if available)

# Phase 3: Core Functionality Development

  - URL construction for searches
  - Page request handling
  - HTML parsing
  - Data extraction
- [ ] Data cleaning functions
  - Address standardization
  - Phone number formatting
  - Hours formatting

  - Create backup system
- [ ] Data validation
  - Check for missing values
  - Verify data formats
  - Remove duplicates
- [ ] Data export functionality
  - Save to chosen format
  - Include timestamps
  - Add metadata

# Phase 5: Error Handling & Robustness
- [ ] Implement error handling
  - Connection issues
  - Missing data
  - Invalid responses
- [ ] Add retry mechanism
  - Failed requests
  - Rate limiting handling
  - Session management
- [ ] Logging system
  - Error logging
  - Success tracking
  - Performance metrics

Would you like me to explain any of these sections in more detail before we move forward? Also, are there any specific aspects of the project that you'd like to add to this checklist?
