# Image Generator Tool - Technical Design Document

## 1. Architecture Overview

### 1.1 System Architecture

The **Logocraft App Images** tool follows a modular, layered architecture to separate the core image processing logic from the user interface and error handling. The primary components of the system are:

1. **Input Handling**: Accepts the user's input through drag-and-drop functionality or a file dialog.
2. **Image Processor**: Core logic that resizes and processes the images.
3. **Format Manager**: Manages various image output formats and dimensions based on configuration.
4. **GUI Interface**: Provides a user-friendly interface for interaction and visual feedback, including progress tracking.
5. **Error Handling**: Handles any unexpected issues with graceful error messages.
6. **Batch Processing**: Processes multiple images simultaneously.

The system is designed to handle both single-image and batch processing efficiently, while maintaining high-quality output.

```

### 1.3 Data Flow

1. **Input**: The user selects one or more images via drag-and-drop or file dialog.
2. **Processing**: The **Image Processor** resizes the images to fit the required dimensions while preserving aspect ratio.
3. **Output**: The images are converted into the specified formats by the **Format Manager** and saved in the output directory chosen by the user.
4. **Progress Tracking**: The **GUI** provides visual feedback of the progress while processing.
5. **Error Handling**: Any issues during the process (e.g., invalid image format or output directory errors) are captured and displayed by the **Error Handling** component.

## 2. Detailed Design

### 2.1 Core Components

#### 2.1.1 Image Processor

```python
class ImageProcessor:
    """
    Core image processing functionality
    
    Responsibilities:
    - Resize input images to required dimensions
    - Preserve aspect ratio during resizing
    - Convert image backgrounds to white for icons
    
    Methods:
    - resize_image(input_image, target_size)
    - convert_to_white_background(input_image)
    """
    
    def resize_image(self, input_image, target_size):
        # Resize image logic to preserve aspect ratio
        pass
    
    def convert_to_white_background(self, input_image):
        # Convert icon background to white
        pass
```

#### 2.1.2 Format Manager

```python
class FormatManager:
    """
    Handles different output formats and dimensions
    
    Responsibilities:
    - Store output format specifications
    - Provide functionality to output resized images in different formats
    
    Methods:
    - get_format_specifications(format_name)
    - save_resized_image(resized_image, format_name, output_dir)
    """
    
    def get_format_specifications(self, format_name):
        # Retrieve format size from configuration
        pass
    
    def save_resized_image(self, resized_image, format_name, output_dir):
        # Save the resized image in the specified format and output directory
        pass
```

#### 2.1.3 GUI Interface

```python
class GUI:
    """
    User interface implementation
    
    Responsibilities:
    - Provide drag-and-drop functionality for user input
    - Display progress and error messages to the user
    - Allow users to select the output directory
    
    Methods:
    - display_progress_bar(percentage)
    - show_error_message(error_message)
    - start_image_processing(input_image)
    """
    
    def display_progress_bar(self, percentage):
        # Show a progress bar with the current processing percentage
        pass
    
    def show_error_message(self, error_message):
        # Display an error message to the user
        pass
    
    def start_image_processing(self, input_image):
        # Start the image processing and update progress
        pass
```

### 2.2 Algorithms

- **Image Scaling Algorithm**: Uses an algorithm (e.g., PILâ€™s `Image.resize`) that resizes images proportionally to the target dimensions, ensuring that no image is stretched or squished.
- **Color Conversion Process**: For icons, a process is applied to ensure that the background is always converted to white, regardless of the original background color.
- **Aspect Ratio Preservation Method**: The aspect ratio is preserved during resizing by calculating the scaling factor based on the width and height ratios, ensuring the image fits within the target dimensions.

### 2.3 Data Structures

- **Input Image Representation**: The input image is represented as an object or file that can be processed by the **Image Processor** class.
- **Output Format Specifications**: The output format details (e.g., size, type) are stored in a configuration dictionary or JSON file, enabling flexibility for adding new formats.
- **Configuration Storage**: All configurable options (e.g., output formats, directory paths) are stored in a central configuration file to allow for easy updates.

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1 Dependencies

- **Pillow**: Used for image manipulation (resizing, converting backgrounds, etc.).
- **tkinter** or **PyQt**: Used to implement the drag-and-drop GUI interface.
- **os, shutil**: For handling file system operations (saving images, directory handling).
- **progressbar**: To display progress while the images are being processed.

```bash
pip install pillow tkinter progressbar
```

### 3.2 Configuration

The configuration will store all the output formats and their corresponding dimensions. Here's an example configuration in Python:

```python
CONFIG = {
    'FORMATS': {
        'APPICON.PNG': (1024, 1024),
        'DEFAULT.PNG': (1242, 1902),
        'DEFAULT_LG.PNG': (1242, 2208),
        'DEFAULT_XL.PNG': (1242, 2688),
        'FEATURE_GRAPHIC.PNG': (1024, 500),
        'LOGO.PNG': (1024, 1024),  # Logo size options
        'Push.png': (96, 96),
    },
    'OUTPUT_DIR': '/path/to/output/directory',
    'INPUT_FORMAT': 'PNG',
}
```

### 3.3 Error Handling

```python
class ImageGeneratorError(Exception):
    """
    Custom error handling for the Image Generator Tool
    
    Responsibilities:
    - Define different types of errors related to image processing
    
    Error Types:
    - InvalidFileFormatError
    - OutputDirectoryError
    - ProcessingError
    """
    
    def __init__(self, message, error_type):
        self.message = message
        self.error_type = error_type
        super().__init__(self.message)
```

## 4. Testing Strategy

### 4.1 Unit Tests

- **Component Test Specifications**: Tests will focus on individual components like **ImageProcessor** (resizing), **FormatManager** (format handling), and **GUI** (UI functionality).
- **Test Data Requirements**: Use various PNG files, including edge cases such as very small images, and test output for each format.
- **Coverage Requirements**: Aim for 90% coverage for the core functionality, focusing on resizing logic and format management.

### 4.2 Integration Tests

- **System Integration Test Plans**: Ensure that all components interact smoothly. For example, a test case will check if the entire process (input -> processing -> output) works as expected.
- **Performance Test Specifications**: Verify that the tool handles batch processing efficiently, even with large images.
- **Error Handling Verification**: Tests will simulate error scenarios (e.g., missing output directory, invalid image format) to ensure that error handling works as expected.

## 5. Deployment

### 5.1 Installation

- **Installation Procedure**: As described earlier, the tool will be installed via pip using the following command:
    
    ```bash
    pip install logocraft-app-images
    ```
    
- **System Preparation Steps**: Ensure that Python 3.7+ is installed, and required libraries like Pillow and tkinter are available.
- **Verification Process**: Run a sample image processing task to verify that the tool is installed correctly.

### 5.2 Configuration

- **Configuration File Format**: The configuration file is a Python dictionary, which specifies the formats and output directory.
- **Default Settings**: The default settings will include common output formats (as mentioned earlier) and a default output directory.
- **Customization Options**: Users can update the configuration file to add custom formats or change the output directory.
