# Image Generator Tool - Requirements Specification

## 1. System Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

The **Logocraft App Images** tool is designed to streamline the process of generating various image assets from a single input file. Its primary purpose is to automate the resizing and formatting of images, such as app icons and splash screens, for use across different platforms (e.g., mobile apps, web, and promotional materials). This tool serves developers, designers, and marketing professionals by reducing manual image preparation tasks, saving time and ensuring consistency across multiple image formats.

**Business Value**:

- Speeds up the development cycle for app deployment by automatically generating the necessary image assets.
- Ensures high-quality, consistent branding with no loss in image quality.
- Improves the overall workflow for marketing professionals by providing a one-stop solution for generating optimized images for various platforms.

### 1.2 Scope

**Inclusions**:

- The system will support generating images from a single input file.
- It will support multiple image formats, including PNG, JPG, and JPEG.
- The system will handle resizing while preserving the aspect ratio and applying specific image enhancements, such as converting icon backgrounds to white.
- The system will support a drag-and-drop interface for easier file selection and batch image processing.
- It will allow the user to specify an output directory for saving processed images.
- The tool will handle multiple image processing tasks concurrently.
- Progress feedback (percentage completion) will be provided during the image processing stage.
- Error handling and graceful recovery mechanisms will be incorporated into the system.

**Exclusions**:

- The tool will not support unsupported file formats (e.g., SVG, TIFF).
- No advanced image editing (e.g., cropping or filtering) will be supported—only resizing and background conversion.
- Integration with third-party services (e.g., cloud storage or external APIs) is not part of this tool’s functionality.

### 1.3 Definitions

- **Aspect Ratio**: The proportional relationship between an image’s width and height.
- **Background Conversion**: The process of changing the background color of icons (e.g., from transparent to white).
- **Drag-and-Drop**: A feature allowing users to upload input files by dragging them into the application interface.
- **Output Formats**: The specific image formats that the tool supports for generating resized assets.
- **Batch Processing**: The ability to process multiple images simultaneously, saving time when dealing with large volumes of files.
- **Progress Tracking**: A system feature to monitor the percentage of completion during the image processing phase.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Input Processing

- **Input File Formats Supported**: PNG, JPG, JPEG.
- **Input Validation Requirements**:
    - The input file must be a valid image (i.e., not corrupted).
    - The input file must adhere to the supported formats.
- **Input Size Limitations**:
    - There is no hard size limit for input images; however, very large files (greater than 10MB) may result in performance degradation.

### 2.2 Image Processing

- **Processing Algorithms**:
    - **Resizing Algorithm**: The image will be resized to the target dimensions while preserving the original aspect ratio.
    - **Background Conversion**: Icons and images requiring a transparent background will be converted to a solid white background for consistency.
- **Quality Preservation Specifications**:
    - All images will maintain high resolution during resizing, ensuring no pixelation or distortion.
    - For icons, the tool will adjust transparency to solid white where applicable.
- **Memory Management Requirements**:
    - The tool will release unused memory after each image processing task to prevent memory leaks.
    - The tool should handle images up to 50MB efficiently, using Python’s `gc` (garbage collection) module to manage memory usage.

### 2.3 Output Generation

- **Output Format Specifications**:
    - Supported formats: PNG.
    - Each image will be resized and saved based on the dimensions specified in the configuration file.
- **File Naming Conventions**:
    - Output file names will be generated based on predefined naming conventions (e.g., `APPICON.PNG`, `DEFAULT.PNG`).
    - Optionally, a timestamp or unique identifier can be added to avoid filename conflicts.
- **Directory Structure Requirements**:
    - The output directory will store generated images organized by format type. The user will have the option to specify the output directory before processing begins.

### 2.4 User Interface

- **GUI Specifications**:
    - The application will have a drag-and-drop interface for input image selection.
    - A progress bar will indicate the percentage of completion during image processing.
    - Clear error messages and status updates will be displayed.
    - The GUI will include options for selecting the output directory.
- **User Input Requirements**:
    - The user must provide an image to be processed (single or multiple).
    - The user must select the desired output directory.
    - The user can initiate the process through a button or by dropping images into the application window.
- **Display Requirements**:
    - The progress bar should update in real-time during image processing.
    - Any errors encountered during the processing (e.g., invalid image format or insufficient permissions) should be displayed in a dialog box.

### 2.5 Error Handling

- **Error Scenarios**:
    - Invalid file format (e.g., user attempts to upload a file not in PNG/JPG/JPEG format).
    - The output directory does not exist or cannot be written to.
    - Memory issues when processing large images.
    - Invalid input image (e.g., corrupted or unreadable file).
- **Error Messages**:
    - "Invalid file format. Please upload a PNG, JPG, or JPEG."
    - "Error: Unable to write to the selected output directory."
    - "Processing error: Image size too large."
- **Recovery Procedures**:
    - The tool will prompt the user to provide a valid file or directory if errors are encountered.
    - It will attempt to recover from memory-related issues by freeing up unused resources and notifying the user if the issue persists.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Performance

- **Processing Time Requirements**:
    - The tool should process each image in under 10 seconds for typical sizes (1024x1024 or smaller).
    - Processing time may increase with larger images or multiple images being processed concurrently.
- **Resource Utilization Limits**:
    - CPU and memory usage should not exceed 80% under normal operation.
- **Concurrent Processing Capabilities**:
    - The system should handle up to 10 images simultaneously with minimal degradation in performance.

- **Input File Validation**:
    - The tool will validate input files to ensure that they are not corrupted or of unsupported types.
- **Output File Permissions**:
    - The output directory must have write permissions for the user running the application.
- **System Access Controls**:
    - The tool will not have any system-wide access controls but will operate within the user’s file system permissions.

### 3.3 Reliability

    - The system must ensure that processed images are not corrupted or lost during processing.

### 3.4 Maintainability

- **Code Documentation Requirements**:
    - The source code must be well-documented, with clear comments on all functions, classes, and complex logic.
