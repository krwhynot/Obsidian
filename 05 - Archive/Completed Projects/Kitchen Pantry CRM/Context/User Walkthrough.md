Let me walk you through the user experience of the CRM system as if I were giving you a tour:

Dashboard (Home Page) When you first log in, you'll land on your personalized dashboard. Here you'll see:

- Your high-priority tasks for the week
- Recent interactions that need follow-up
- Upcoming meetings or scheduled interactions
- A quick view of your A-priority organizations
- Weekly goals and progress tracking

The dashboard has a clean navigation bar at the top with access to all main sections: Organizations, Contacts, Interactions, and Reports.

Organizations Page Think of this as your main hub for company management. When you click into Organizations, you'll see a data grid showing all organizations you're managing. You can:

- Sort by priority (A-D)
- Filter by segment (Fine Dining, Healthcare, etc.)
- Search by organization name
- View which distributors they're using

When you click on an organization, you'll see their detailed profile page showing:

- All basic information (address, phone, etc.)
- A list of all contacts within that organization
- Recent interactions history
- Current opportunities
- Notes and important updates

The "Add New Organization" button is prominently displayed for quick data entry.

Contacts Page This page helps you manage all your individual relationships. You'll see:

- A searchable list of all contacts
- Their organizations and positions
- Contact methods (phone, email, LinkedIn)

Think of this system as your digital sales assistant - everything is interconnected.

The system is designed to help you focus on building relationships while it handles the organization and tracking of all your customer data.
