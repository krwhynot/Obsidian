**Project Planning**
A Windows desktop application project for processing call recordings using Python. The application interfaces with a Telephony API to download and process MP3 files using OrderIDs, handling batches of up to 9,000 calls. Core features include automated transcription, silence detection, keyword tracking ('oops'), and consolidated HTML reporting. The application requires a user-friendly GUI with real-time progress monitoring, batch processing capabilities, persistent queues, and robust error handling. Key technical requirements include efficient resource management, automated cleanup processes, comprehensive logging, and compatibility with Windows 10 and above. The end goal is to streamline call analysis workflow through automation while providing detailed, filterable reports highlighting specific audio patterns and keywords.
## 1. Project Overview

- **Project Name**: CHAT (Call Handling & Analysis Tool) Project
- **Description**:  
    This is a Windows desktop application for processing call recordings by retrieving MP3 audio files via a Telephony API using OrderIDs. It will:
    - Transcribe large batches of calls (up to ~9,000).
    - Handle downloading and transcribing calls.
    - Generate a single, consolidated HTML report with silence detection and keyword (“oops”) tracking.
    - Provide a user-friendly GUI with start, pause, resume, cancel, clear, and real-time progress monitoring.
    - Support batch processing, persistent queues, error handling, retries, automated cleanup, and logging.
    - Allow sorting and filtering in the output report.
    - Adapt resource usage and run efficiently on Windows 10 and above.

**Core Purpose**:

- Create a desktop tool that automates call recording downloads and transcriptions.
- Consolidate results into a single HTML report highlighting silence detection after a key phrase and calls containing “oops.”
- Streamline the processing workflow with a GUI and persistent state management.

## 2. Problem Statement

- Processing and analyzing thousands of call recordings manually is slow, error-prone, and inefficient.
- A need exists for an automated system that can handle large-scale audio retrieval, transcription, and reporting with minimal manual intervention and comprehensive real-time feedback.

## 3. Objectives

- **Objective 1**: Automate the retrieval, transcription, and analysis of large batches of call recordings from given OrderIDs.
- **Objective 2**: Offer a GUI with Start, Pause, Resume, Cancel, and Clear controls, along with persistent progress tracking and real-time status displays.
- **Objective 3**: Produce an incremental, consolidated HTML report featuring silence detection flags, “oops” keyword occurrences, sorting, and filtering capabilities.

## 4. Requirements

- **Functional Requirements**:
    1. Input Handling:
        - Load OrderIDs from a text file or enter a single OrderID.
        - Maintain a persistent queue to resume processing after the app restarts.
    2. Controls:
        - Start/Pause/Resume processing.
        - Cancel current operation.
        - Clear the OrderID queue.
    3. Status Display:
        - Show current OrderID.
        - Display completed/remaining counts.
        - Show download/transcription status.
        - Track errors and retries.
        - Calculate ETA using a moving average.
    4. Processing:
        - Integrate with the Telephony API for audio downloads.
        - Use OpenAI Whisper for transcription.
        - Automatically clean up temporary files after processing.
        - Support concurrent processing for performance optimization.
    5. Output:
        - Generate an HTML report incrementally as calls are processed.
        - Flag silence detected after the specific phrase.
        - Indicate calls containing “oops” and summarize this count.
        - Enable sorting and filtering within the HTML report.
- **Non-Functional Requirements**:
    - Windows 10 compatibility.
    - Efficient resource usage; adapt to varying system specs.
    - SQLite database for queue persistence and progress storage.
    - Logging with rotation, system health checks, and error handling.
    - Scalable design for handling thousands of audio files.
    - Support parallel/async operations via PyQt6 and related tools if performance benefits are observed.

## 5. The WHO

- **WHO 1**: Data analysts needing complete transcripts, silence detection data, and performance metrics.
- **WHO 2**: Developers or technicians responsible for maintaining and improving the transcription system.

## 6. Tools and Technologies

- **Languages/Frameworks**:
    - Python 3.12+ for core functionality.
    - OpenAI Whisper for speech-to-text.
    - PyQt6 for the GUI.
- **Tools**:
    - SQLite for data persistence.
    - Logging frameworks for error/event logging.
    - HTML/CSS for the consolidated report layout and styling.

## 7. Project Structure

- **Core Application Layer**:  
    Handles downloading audio files, transcribing them, detecting silence, and identifying “oops” occurrences.
- **Data Layer**:  
    Uses SQLite to store and manage the OrderID queue and progress states.
- **GUI Layer**:  
    Built with PyQt6 to provide interactive controls (Start, Pause, Resume, Cancel, Clear) and real-time status updates.
- **Report Generation**:  
    Creates and updates an HTML report incrementally, applying sorting, filtering, and flagging silence or “oops” keywords.
- **Utilities**:  
    Includes logging, configuration handling, error management, automated cleanup, and system health checks.
