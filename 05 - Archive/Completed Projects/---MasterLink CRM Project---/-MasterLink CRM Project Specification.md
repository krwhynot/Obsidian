The Excel workbook contains multiple sheets, each with distinct purposes. Here's a breakdown of the sheets that would be useful for creating an AI system prompt:

1. **Team Performance Dashboard**: Likely a visual summary of team metrics and KPIs, combining data from other sheets to show performance trends and insights.
    
2. **Principal Activity Tracker**: Could track key activities or engagements for specific individuals, such as tasks completed, meetings held, or progress toward goals.
    
3. **Dashboard**: A general-purpose visualization or summary layer, integrating data across multiple sheets for high-level insights.
    
4. **Organizations**: Contains data about businesses or entities, likely used to structure CRM insights, track partnerships, and record organizational details.

- Generate insights on team and organizational performance.
- Predict sales outcomes or opportunity likelihood.
- Automate repetitive CRM tasks like updating records or generating reports.
- Personalize customer interactions based on historical data.
