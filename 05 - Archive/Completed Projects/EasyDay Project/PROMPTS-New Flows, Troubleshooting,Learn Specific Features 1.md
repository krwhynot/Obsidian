1. **For New Flows**:
```
Create a Power Automate flow that [goal]
- Show the exact interface steps
- Include all connector cards and fields
- Show dynamic content where used
```

```
"Create a detailed visual flowchart for a Microsoft Power Automate flow that achieves the following goal: [goal]. The flowchart should include all action cards, variables, dynamic content, and any other necessary details to construct a complete Power Automate flow. Be sure to:

- Show the exact interface steps.

```

2. **For Troubleshooting**:
```

```

3. **For Learning Specific Features**:
```
Show me how to use [feature] in Power Automate

```

For example:
"Create a Power Automate flow that monitors a SharePoint list for new items. Show me the exact interface cards, required fields, and dynamic content options for each step."

Would you like to:
1. Try one of these prompt formats with a specific scenario?
2. Have me suggest more specific prompt templates?
3. Focus on a particular type of Power Automate solution?

This will help me provide responses that match the actual Power Automate interface more closely.
