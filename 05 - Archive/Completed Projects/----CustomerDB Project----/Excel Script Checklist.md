Okay, here is a checklist outlining the tasks performed by the provided Office Script:

**I. Initialization & Setup:**

- [ ] Start script execution.
- [ ] Accept parameters: Workbook object, Table Name (from dropdown), Target Empty Rows count.
- [ ] Initialize an empty array to store log messages.
- [ ] Start a `try...catch` block for overall error handling.
- [ ] Get the currently active worksheet (used for a context check).

**II. Table Identification & Validation:**

- [ ] Call `getTable` function:
    - [ ] Attempt to find the specified table (`tableName`) within the workbook.
    - [ ] If table not found: Log error and stop script execution.
    - [ ] If table found: Log success message and return table object.
- [ ] Check if the found table resides on the initially active worksheet.
    - [ ] If not, log a warning message (but continue execution on the table's actual sheet).
- [ ] Get the number of columns in the table.

**III. Column Standardization (`standardizeTableColumns` loop for each column):**

- [ ] For each column in the table:
    - [ ] Get the data body range (rows between header and total, if any).
    - [ ] Check if the column contains any data rows.
    - [ ] If data rows exist:
        - [ ] Identify the first data row cell (`sourceCell`) as the template.
        - [ ] **Store Formulas:** Read and store all formulas from the column's data range.
        - [ ] **Apply Formats:** Copy cell formatting (font, fill, number format, etc.) from `sourceCell` to the entire column data range.
        - [ ] **Restore Formulas:** Write the stored formulas back into the column data range.
        - [ ] **Apply Data Validation (Attempted - _Note: This part is flawed in the provided code_):**
            - [ ] Get data validation settings from `sourceCell`.
            - [ ] Loop through the _remaining_ cells in the column's data range (cell by cell).
            - [ ] For each cell: Attempt to clear existing validation and apply the validation from `sourceCell` (using an incorrect `.load()` method, which will likely fail). Log a warning if application fails for a cell.
    - [ ] If no data rows exist: Skip standardization for this column.
- [ ] Log completion of the column standardization process.

**IV. Empty Row Removal (`removeEmptyRows`):**

- [ ] Get the table's data body range.
- [ ] If no data body range: Log message and skip removal.
- [ ] Read all values from the data body range.
- [ ] Iterate through the read values row by row.
- [ ] Identify rows where _all_ cells are empty (`""` or `null`).
- [ ] Count the number of non-empty rows encountered.
- [ ] If empty rows were identified:
    - [ ] Sort the indices of empty rows in descending order.
    - [ ] Loop through the sorted indices and delete each corresponding row from the table using `table.deleteRowsAt()`.
    - [ ] Log the number of rows removed and their indices.
- [ ] If no empty rows were found: Log message.
- [ ] Return the count of non-empty rows found _before_ deletion.

~~**V. Add Empty Rows to Table End (`addFormattedEmptyRows`):**~~

- [ ] ~~Check if `targetEmptyRows` count is greater than 0.~~
- [ ] ~~If yes:~~
    - [ ] ~~Add the specified number (`targetEmptyRows`) of new, blank rows to the end of the table, one row at a time.~~
    - [ ] ~~After adding rows, get the updated data body range.~~
    - [ ] ~~Identify a template row (the first data row, if any rows exist).~~
    - [ ] ~~Calculate the range corresponding to _only_ the newly added rows.~~
    - [ ] ~~If a template row was identified: Copy _only formats_ from the template row to the range of newly added rows.~~
    - [ ] ~~Log progress and completion.~~
- [ ] ~~If `targetEmptyRows` is 0 or less: Log message and skip.~~

**VI. Final Logging & Completion:**

- [ ] Log the final structure summary (initial non-empty row count + target empty rows added).
- [ ] If any error occurred during steps II-V, log the error message (caught by the main `try...catch`).
- [ ] Output all collected log messages to the console (`finally` block).
