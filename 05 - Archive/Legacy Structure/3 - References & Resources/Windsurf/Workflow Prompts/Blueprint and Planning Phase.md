# Workflow: Blueprint and Planning Phase

<!--
This workflow guides the project through system architecture visualization, requirement documentation,
and an initial step-by-step implementation plan â€” prior to any code being written.
It is copy-ready and compliant with your `.windsurf/workflows/` requirements.
-->

## Description

Establish the architectural blueprint, define project requirements, and generate a detailed plan before development begins.

---

## Steps

1. **Visualize Architecture**
   - Use Mermaid to map out system components and relationships.
   - Example: Generate Mermaid diagram showing services, databases, and APIs.

2. **Define High-Level Requirements**
   - Document major features and constraints.
   - Create a `project-config.md` or similar to store requirements and coding rules.

3. **Specify Coding Standards**
   - Include naming conventions, folder structure, language rules, etc.
   - Add them as a dedicated section in the documentation or config.

4. **Generate Implementation Plan**
   - Use AI to produce detailed pseudocode or task sequence.
   - Ensure plan reflects system architecture and coding rules.

5. **Await User Approval**
   - DO NOT proceed to coding until human has approved the plan.
   - Add comment like: `<!-- Human confirmation required before moving forward -->`

## Notes

<!--
- Each step is designed to be completed before any code is written.
- This sets the foundation for a maintainable, well-structured codebase.
- This file is copy-ready and compliant with your `.windsurf/workflows/` directory format.
