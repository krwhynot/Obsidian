  Executive Summary

  As a food broker industry expert, I've conducted comprehensive analysis of food service operations, data entry patterns, reporting workflows,
  and compliance requirements. Food brokers manage complex multi-party relationships between manufacturers and distributors, handling $2+
  billion in annual sales volume with sophisticated territory management, commission tracking, and reorder automation needs.

  Key Findings:
  - Food brokers require specialized CRM workflows distinct from traditional restaurant operations
  - Manual data entry costs 0.25-2% of contracted spend in pricing errors (ArrowStream Research)
  - 80% time reduction achievable through automation (ArrowStream Best Practices)
  - Territory and commission management are critical differentiators

  2. Efficient Data Entry Pattern Design ✅

  Context-Aware Data Entry

  Smart Form Patterns:

  // Customer Visit Form with Smart Defaults
  interface CustomerVisitForm {
    customerId: string;           // Auto-populates based on territory
    visitType: 'Routine' | 'Sample' | 'Promotional' | 'Competitive';
    productsDiscussed: string[];  // Suggests based on customer history
    nextVisitDate: Date;         // Auto-calculates based on visit frequency
    competitorActivity?: string;  // Quick-entry for competitive intel
  }

  3. Contextual Field Pre-Population
  - Customer Context: Auto-suggest products based on purchase history
  - Territory Context: Filter customers by rep's assigned territory
  - Seasonal Context: Suggest seasonal products based on calendar

  2. Batch Operation Patterns
  // Territory Assignment Batch Operation
  const batchTerritoryUpdate = {
    operation: 'TERRITORY_ASSIGN',
    criteria: { state: 'California', customerType: 'Independent' },
    assignments: { repId: 'REP001', effectiveDate: '2025-01-01' }
  };

  3. Mobile-First Data Entry
  - Quick Actions: Swipe gestures for common tasks (schedule visit, mark complete)
  - Voice Notes: Voice-to-text for call summaries and competitive intelligence
  - Photo Integration: Product displays, store conditions, competitive pricing

      'schedule' => '0 8 * * 1', // Monday 8 AM
      'condition' => 'territory.hasActiveRep == true',
      'actions' => [
          'generateReport' => 'territoryPerformance',
          'emailReport' => 'assignedRep'
