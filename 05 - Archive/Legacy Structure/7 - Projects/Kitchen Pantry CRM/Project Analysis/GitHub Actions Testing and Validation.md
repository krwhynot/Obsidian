    - Comprehensive test suites with coverage enforcement
    - Performance testing for Azure B1
    - Security scanning integration
    - Deployment validation

  3. Security Scanning Workflows ✅

  - .github/workflows/security-enhanced.yml - Advanced security scanning:

    - Health monitoring
    - Automated rollback procedures
    - Deployment snapshots
  - tests/e2e/smoke.spec.ts - Smoke tests for deployment validation

  5. Workflow Orchestration Testing ✅

  - .github/workflows/workflow-orchestration-test.yml - Tests for:
    - Job dependencies and sequencing
    - Conditional execution
    - Parallel job coordination
    - Timeout and cancellation handling
    - Artifact sharing between jobs
    - Concurrency controls

  6. Performance Optimization ✅

  - scripts/performance-validation.sh - Performance testing script
  - .github/workflows/performance-optimization.yml - Automated performance testing:
    - Bundle size analysis
    - Build performance metrics
    - Runtime memory usage
    - Response time testing
    - Lighthouse CI integration

  7. Next.js Specific Testing ✅

  - .github/workflows/nextjs-specific-tests.yml - Validates:
    - React 19 and Server Components
    - App Router structure
    - Prisma integration
    - Tremor Charts usage
    - Static generation and ISR
    - Middleware configuration

  8. Documentation & Checklists ✅

  - docs/GITHUB_ACTIONS_TESTING_GUIDE.md - Comprehensive testing guide
  - .github/PRE_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md - Detailed pre-deployment checklist

  Key Features

  Local Testing with Act

  # Validate all workflows
  ./scripts/validate-workflows.sh

  # Run specific workflow locally
  act -W .github/workflows/enhanced-ci-cd.yml

  # Test with specific Node version
  act --matrix node-version:20

  Performance Validation

  # Run all performance tests
  ./scripts/performance-validation.sh

  # Test specific aspects
  ./scripts/performance-validation.sh build
  ./scripts/performance-validation.sh bundle
  ./scripts/performance-validation.sh load

  Security Testing

  # Run security workflow locally
  act -W .github/workflows/security-enhanced.yml --input scan_type=full

  Deployment Testing

  # Validate deployment
  act -W .github/workflows/deployment-validation.yml --input action=validate

  # Test rollback
  act -W .github/workflows/deployment-validation.yml --input action=rollback

  Success Metrics

  All workflows are configured to ensure:
  - Build Success Rate: 100% across all Node.js versions
  - Test Coverage: Minimum 80% (90% for critical components)
  - Security: Zero high/critical vulnerabilities
  - Performance: Optimized for Azure B1 tier (< 1.75GB RAM)
  - Build Time: Under 5 minutes
  - Bundle Size: Under 50MB
  - Deployment Success: 100% with rollback capability

  Next Steps

  1. Install Act:
  curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nektos/act/master/install.sh | sudo bash
  2. Run Initial Validation:
  ./scripts/validate-workflows.sh
  3. Test a Workflow Locally:
  act -W .github/workflows/enhanced-ci-cd.yml -n  # Dry run
  4. Configure Secrets: Update .env.act with your actual values for testing
  5. Run Performance Tests:
  ./scripts/performance-validation.sh

  All configurations are ready for immediate use and optimized for your Azure B1 deployment constraints!
