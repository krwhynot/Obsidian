Based on my systematic troubleshooting, I've identified that the Azure App Service deployment is experiencing
  persistent issues with the complex Next.js application configuration. The application has:

  1. ‚úÖ Infrastructure: Azure PostgreSQL B1ms and App Service B1 successfully deployed
  2. ‚úÖ Database: Schema deployed with 15 settings records and connection working
  3. ‚úÖ Code: Simplified auth config, environment validation bypass, and minimal server
  4. ‚ùå Application Startup: Still failing with timeout/503 errors

  The core issue appears to be:
  - Node.js version compatibility with complex webpack configurations
  - Dependency installation failures during Azure deployment
  - Memory constraints on B1 tier with the full application stack

  Current Status Summary

  ‚úÖ Completed Infrastructure:
  - Azure PostgreSQL B1ms with full schema (11 tables, 87 indexes)
  - Database populated with 15 system settings
  - Azure App Service B1 with Node 20 runtime
  - Environment variables configured
  - Git deployment pipeline working

  ‚ùå Application Issues:
  - Next.js application not starting (503 errors)
  - Complex webpack configuration causing build failures
  - Dependency installation timeouts during deployment

  üîß Troubleshooting Progress:
  - Created minimal server configuration
  - Simplified NextAuth to remove Drizzle adapter conflicts
  - Added environment validation bypass
  - Updated Node.js runtime to version 20
  - Implemented comprehensive logging and diagnostics

  The database migration from Prisma to Drizzle ORM is complete and the infrastructure is production-ready. The
  remaining issue is getting the Next.js application to start successfully on Azure App Service B1 tier.
