Need to change UI , database, etc. to show the following:

- One of the major goals of an Account Manager is to track activity of a Principal.
- Activities are Interactions and Opportunities 
- Interactions and Opportunities can have multiple Principals
- Principals are Organizations
- Not all Organizations are Principals. 
- Organizations are Principals if their info has the Principal Checkbox checked. 
- A Principal own Products
- Products has a dropdown to select their Principals.

Create a checklist of tasks that will help make these changes
