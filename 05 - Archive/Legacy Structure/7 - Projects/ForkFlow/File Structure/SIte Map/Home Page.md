<Task> Strictly follow the instructions in `create_home_page.md` to implement the homepage, making no changes unless explicitly allowed. </Task> 

<Instructions> You are provided with `create_homepage.md`, which contains exact instructions for building the homepage.

Your task is as follows:

1. **Follow every instruction in `create_homepage.md` exactly as written.**    
    - Do **not** change or reinterpret any step.
        
    - The **only exception** is if an instruction requires an API key or sensitive credential ‚Äî in that case, replace it with a placeholder comment like `// TODO: Insert API key here`.
        
2. **Review the rest of the project codebase** (outside of `create_homepage.md`) for any inconsistencies or outdated code that conflicts with the new homepage implementation.
    
    - Make minimal, precise modifications only to **align these other files** with the structure, styling, or logic defined by `create_homepage.md`.
        
    - Do **not** introduce any extra features, renames, or logic refactors outside the homepage scope.
        
3. Document the modified files and briefly explain each change at the end of your response under a `<!-- Modified Files Summary -->` section.
    

‚ö†Ô∏è **Strict Rule**: No deviations from `create_homepage.md` are allowed except for inserting placeholders where API keys or credentials are required.

Output the updated code wrapped in `<updated_code>` tags.
