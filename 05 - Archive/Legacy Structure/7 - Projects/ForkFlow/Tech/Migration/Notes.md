- [ ] ## 📝 UI-Kits Folder

- All components are styled with Tailwind CSS and support `className` for custom styles.
- Some advanced MUI features (e.g., transitions, popovers) may require custom implementation or use of Headless UI primitives.
- For icons, consider using [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) or another icon library, as MUI icons are not included in the UI kit.
- For any missing features or edge cases, extend the component or open a PR.
