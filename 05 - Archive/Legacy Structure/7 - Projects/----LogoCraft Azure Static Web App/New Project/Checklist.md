Remembering...

Let me review all the code files to identify completed and incomplete tasks for LogoCraft Web.

Based on my analysis of the provided code files and documentation, here's what I've found:

<completed_tasks>

1. **Frontend UI Components** - All React components are complete:
    
    - ImagePreview.jsx - handles drag-and-drop upload functionality
    - OutputOptions.jsx - contains format selection with grouped checkboxes
    - ProcessingOptions.jsx - includes processing controls with progress bar
    - MainPreview.jsx - displays main preview and processed results
    - StepIndicator.jsx - shows 3-step workflow (Upload → Configure → Download)
    - StatusBar.jsx - displays application status messages
    - ResultsGallery.jsx - shows processed images with download options
    - FormatInfo.jsx - provides information about supported formats
2. **Frontend Services**:
    
    - BlobService.js - Updated for single API endpoint integration, handles SAS token retrieval and image processing requests
3. **Backend Azure Function**:
    
    - Single consolidated function (api/ProcessImage/index.js) handling:
        - SAS token generation for client uploads (`action=getUploadSas`)
        - Image processing with Sharp library (`action=processImage`)
        - Blob storage operations using connection string
    - Function.json configuration for HTTP triggers
4. **Infrastructure as Code**:
    
    - main.bicep - Azure Static Web App with integrated function and storage account
    - Simplified architecture using SAS tokens via connection string
5. **CI/CD Workflows**:
    
    - web-app-deploy.yml - Azure Static Web Apps deployment
    - infrastructure-deploy.yml - Bicep template deployment
    - Removed redundant function-app-deploy.yml
6. **Styling & Layout**:
    
    - Complete App.css with responsive design and horizontal layout
    - Bootstrap integration with custom CSS variables
7. **Code Architecture**:
    
    - Simplified from two separate functions to single consolidated function
    - Updated authentication to use storage connection string instead of Managed Identity
    - Frontend-backend integration using single API endpoint </completed_tasks>

<incomplete_tasks>

1. **Deployment & Testing**:
    
    - Initial deployment of the simplified Azure infrastructure
    - End-to-end testing of the complete flow (upload → processing → download)
    - Verification of Azure Static Web App configuration
    - Testing of function logs and SWA configuration in Azure portal
2. **GitHub Secrets Configuration**:
    
    - Setting up AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN in GitHub repository
    - Ensuring AZURE_CREDENTIALS secret is properly configured
3. **Documentation Updates**:
    
    - Review and update azure-architecture-template.md to align with implemented simplified architecture
    - Update any remaining references to the old two-function approach
4. **Post-Deployment Validation**:
    
    - Verify storage container configurations (uploads private, downloads public)
    - Confirm SWA application settings include AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING
    - Test error handling and edge cases in production environment
5. **User Authentication** (future enhancement):
    
    - Application currently has no user authentication
    - Listed as future improvement for enhanced security
6. **Advanced Features** (future enhancements):
    
    - Re-evaluate and implement Managed Identity for enhanced security
    - API rate limiting
    - Enhanced error reporting and logging
    - Dark mode and improved accessibility features </incomplete_tasks>

The project appears to be code-complete for the simplified Azure implementation, with all core functionality implemented. The main remaining work is in deployment, testing, and validation of the simplified architecture in the Azure environment.
