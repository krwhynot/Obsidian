# LogoCraft Project Planning Document

## Initial Project Understanding

### Core Purpose
LogoCraft is a specialized image processing application designed to solve a common challenge in the restaurant industry: converting logo files between different formats while maintaining quality and consistency. The application specifically handles professional logo conversions with support for advanced formats like HEIF and PSD files, making it valuable for restaurant branding and marketing materials.

### Target Users
The primary users are:
- Restaurant marketing teams who need to prepare logos for different platforms
- Restaurant owners managing their brand assets
- Designers working with restaurant branding materials
- Marketing agencies handling multiple restaurant clients

### Value Proposition
LogoCraft streamlines the logo management process by:
- Eliminating the need for complex image editing software
- Providing consistent, high-quality format conversions
- Supporting professional file formats (PSD, HEIF) out of the box
- Offering batch processing capabilities
- Maintaining image quality standards across all conversions

## Technical Vision

### Core Functionality
The application must:
1. Convert logo files between multiple formats:
   - Read formats: PSD, HEIF/HEIC, PNG, JPEG, BMP
   - Export to various required formats while preserving quality
2. Provide a user-friendly interface:
   - File selection through browsing or drag-and-drop
   - Clear progress indicators during conversion
   - Intuitive output settings
3. Handle batch processing:
   - Multiple file conversion
   - Consistent naming conventions
   - Progress tracking
4. Maintain image quality:
   - Proper color space management
   - Resolution preservation
   - Transparency handling where applicable

### Success Criteria
The project will be considered successful when:
1. Technical Goals:
   - All specified file formats are supported
   - Conversions maintain professional quality standards
   - Batch processing handles 50+ files efficiently
   - Error handling prevents data loss
   
2. User Experience Goals:
   - Interface is intuitive for non-technical users
   - Conversion process requires minimal user input
   - Clear feedback during file processing
   - Consistent output quality across all formats

### Technical Requirements
Based on current project files:
1. Core Technologies:
   - Python with Tkinter for GUI
   - Pillow for basic image processing
   - pillow-heif for HEIF/HEIC support
   - psd-tools for Photoshop file handling
   - numpy/scipy for advanced image operations

2. Build System:
   - PyInstaller for executable creation
   - Virtual environment management
   - Proper dependency handling

3. Additional Requirements:
   - Logging system for error tracking
   - Configuration management
   - Resource bundling

## Motivation & Impact

### Personal Investment
The project represents an opportunity to:
1. Develop expertise in:
   - Professional-grade image processing
   - GUI application development
   - Build system management
   - Error handling and logging

2. Create real business value by:
   - Solving a specific industry need
   - Streamlining workflow for marketing teams
   - Reducing technical barriers for users

### Expected Outcomes
Short-term:
1. A reliable tool for restaurant logo conversion
2. Reduced time spent on format conversion tasks
3. Consistent quality across all exported formats

Long-term:
1. Expanded format support based on user needs
2. Potential integration with other restaurant management tools
3. Building a foundation for other industry-specific tools

### Success Metrics
Quantitative:
1. Conversion speed (under 5 seconds per file)
2. Batch processing efficiency (50+ files without errors)
3. File size optimization (maintaining quality under target sizes)
4. Zero data loss during conversions

Qualitative:
1. User satisfaction with interface
2. Output quality matching professional standards
3. Reduced support requests for format conversion
4. Positive feedback from marketing teams

## Next Steps

Immediate Actions:
1. Fix module import structure:
   ```python
   # Update main.py imports to use relative paths
   from .gui.main_window import ImageProcessorGUI
   ```

2. Update requirements.txt with missing dependencies:
   ```text
   Pillow==9.5.0
   pillow-heif==0.13.0
   psd-tools==1.9.24
   numpy
   scipy
   scikit-image
   ```

3. Implement basic logging:
   ```python
   import logging
   logging.basicConfig(
       level=logging.INFO,
       format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
       filename='logocraft.log'
   )
   ```

4. Test and document the core conversion pipeline
5. Set up error handling framework

Would you like me to:
1. Provide more detailed technical specifications for any component?
2. Create a structured timeline for implementing these next steps?
3. Develop a testing strategy for the core functionality?
4. Further explore any of the project aspects discussed above?

Let me know what aspect you'd like to focus on first, and I'll help guide you through the implementation process.
