# LogoCraft Project Development Checklist - Verified Components

## 1. Project Analysis & Requirements

### Project Structure
The project currently has these verified components:
- [x] Main project directory with src folder
- [x] Python virtual environment support through build.py
- [x] PyInstaller spec file configuration
- [x] Icon file (HungerRush_Icon.ico)
- [x] Basic requirement specifications
- [x] Git version control (.git directory)

### Technical Dependencies
From requirements.txt and spec file:
- [x] Pillow 9.5.0 for core image processing
- [x] pillow-heif 0.13.0 for HEIF/HEIC support
- [x] psd-tools 1.9.24 for Photoshop file handling
Hidden imports specified in spec file:
- [x] PIL._tkinter_finder and PIL.ImageTk for GUI
- [x] numpy and scipy for image processing
- [x] skimage for additional transformations

## 2. Build System

### Build Script (build.py)
- [x] Virtual environment creation
- [x] Dependencies installation
- [x] PyInstaller integration
- [x] Icon verification
- [x] Build directory cleaning
- [x] Error handling and reporting
- [ ] Verify all hidden imports installation

### PyInstaller Configuration (LogoCraft.spec)
- [x] Main script path configuration
- [x] Hidden imports specification
- [x] Icon integration
- [x] Window mode configuration (console=False)
- [x] Project root path handling
- [ ] Verify all data files inclusion

## 3. Immediate Issues

### Module Import Structure
- [ ] Fix src module import in main.py
- [ ] Implement proper relative imports
- [ ] Test import system with current structure

### Dependency Management
- [ ] Synchronize requirements.txt with spec file imports
- [ ] Add missing numpy dependency
- [ ] Add missing scipy dependency
- [ ] Add missing scikit-image dependency

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Verify Tkinter GUI implementation
- [ ] Test image processing pipeline
- [ ] Implement format conversion handling
- [ ] Set up file input/output system

## 4. Testing Requirements

### Build Process Testing
- [ ] Virtual environment creation
- [ ] Dependencies installation
- [ ] PyInstaller compilation
- [ ] Executable verification
- [ ] Icon integration check

### Functionality Testing
- [ ] GUI window creation
- [ ] Image loading capability
- [ ] Format conversion process
- [ ] File output handling

## 5. Documentation Needs

### Technical Documentation
- [ ] Build process instructions
- [ ] Development environment setup
- [ ] Dependencies list and versions
- [ ] Project structure overview

### Code Documentation
- [ ] Module docstrings
- [ ] Function documentation
- [ ] Class documentation
- [ ] Import structure explanation

## Immediate Action Items

Based on current files, these need immediate attention:
1. Module Import Fix
   - Update main.py import statement
   - Test module resolution
   - Verify package structure

2. Dependencies Update
   - Add numpy to requirements.txt
   - Add scipy to requirements.txt
   - Add scikit-image to requirements.txt
   - Verify all hidden imports are covered

3. Build Process
   - Test virtual environment creation
   - Verify dependency installation
   - Test PyInstaller compilation
   - Verify executable creation

4. Basic Testing
   - Verify icon file access
   - Test build script functionality
   - Check GUI window creation
   - Validate import structure

This checklist now reflects only what we can verify from the actual project files, focusing on the components we can see in:
1. The build.py script
2. The LogoCraft.spec file
3. The requirements.txt file
4. The current directory structure
5. The main.py import issue

Would you like me to:
1. Break down any of these verified components in more detail?
2. Create a specific action plan for addressing the immediate issues?
3. Develop a testing procedure for the build process?
4. Draft documentation for the current project structure?
