Yes ‚Äî using **WPF + Entity Framework Core (EF Core)** is an **excellent stack** for your **Team Scheduling GUI Tool**, especially considering you're new to coding and want a resume-friendly project relevant to HungerRush‚Äôs tech stack.

---

## ‚úÖ Why This Stack Is a Smart Choice

### üéØ 1. **WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)**

- ‚úÖ **Modern** desktop UI framework (unlike WinForms, which is older)    
- ‚úÖ Supports **MVVM pattern**, which teaches clean architecture    
- ‚úÖ Great for **interactive scheduling UIs** (drag & drop, calendars)    
- ‚úÖ Easier to scale into richer apps later
    

> If you can learn WPF early, it puts you ahead of many devs still stuck on WinForms.

---

### üóÉÔ∏è 2. **Entity Framework Core**

- ‚úÖ Simplifies database operations (`DbContext`, LINQ queries)    
- ‚úÖ Works seamlessly with **SQL Server**    
- ‚úÖ You can **code-first** or **db-first** (you already have a SQL database)    
- ‚úÖ You‚Äôll gain experience with:
    
    - Migrations        
    - Query optimization        
    - Relational mapping (EF models = tables)
        

> EF Core is a **must-have resume skill** for .NET devs.

### üß† 3. **How These Fit Together**

```
WPF GUI     ‚Üí     ViewModels     ‚Üí     EF Core     ‚Üí     SQL Database
 (UI)             (Logic)            (Data Layer)      (Persisted Data)
```

You‚Äôll get exposure to:

- UI programming    
- Data binding (WPF)    
- MVVM architecture    
- SQL querying & validation    
- Application-level logic (scheduling, overlap prevention, etc.)

## üõ†Ô∏è Recommendations for Your First Version

|Component|Tech|Why|
|---|---|---|
|UI|WPF + XAML|Modern, customizable|
|Logic Layer|C# Classes + MVVM|Separation of concerns|
|DB Access|EF Core|Simple and powerful|
|Database|SQL Server (LocalDB)|Real-world, resume-aligned|
|Testing (later)|NUnit + Moq|Practice test-driven patterns|
