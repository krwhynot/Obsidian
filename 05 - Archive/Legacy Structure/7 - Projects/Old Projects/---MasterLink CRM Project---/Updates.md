### **Errors Fixed**

#### 1. Formula Errors

- **Contacts Sheet**: Fixed multiple instances of `#REF!` errors and ensured `XLOOKUP` formulas referenced the correct ranges.
- **Dashboard**: Resolved issues with formulas like `COUNTA(#REF!)` and adjusted incorrect formula ranges in cells like `E6`, `E7`, `L7`, and others, affecting summary calculations​Dashboard​04_formulas.

#### 2. Data Validations

- **Opportunities Sheet**: Removed invalid drop-downs referencing `#REF!` values and ensured consistent validation across columns like `SourceList`, `StageList`, and others​03_data_validations.
- **Organizations Sheet**: Corrected custom validations for date formats and numeric entries​03_data_validations.

#### 3. Named Ranges

- Fixed named ranges referring to invalid or mismatched ranges (e.g., `ContactList`, `OperatorList`).
- Corrected dynamic named ranges using `OFFSET` to support automatic expansion of lists like `AcctManagerList` and `DistributorList`​07_named_ranges.

#### 4. Structural Issues

- Adjusted merged cells and frozen panes to ensure formulas calculated correctly across all sheets​02_workbook_structure.
- Ensured all hidden sheets like `Calculations` were properly configured to integrate with visible sheets​02_workbook_structure.

#### 5. Calculation Settings

- Resolved errors in workbook-level calculation settings where `CalcProperties` was undefined​05_calculation_settings.

#### 6. Conditional Formatting

- Fixed broken conditional formatting rules across sheets to ensure visual clarity for data verification​02_workbook_structure.

### **Performance Improvements**

#### 1. Formula Optimization

- Replaced static ranges in formulas with **dynamic ranges** using `OFFSET` and `COUNTA` to ensure scalability without manual adjustments.
- Simplified complex formulas with step-by-step breakdowns to improve maintainability and reduce recalculation times.

#### 2. Named Ranges

- Consolidated and optimized named ranges to remove redundancy and ensure lists dynamically expand based on data growth (e.g., `PriorityList`, `SegmentList`, `SourceList`)​07_named_ranges.

#### 3. Structural Improvements

- Organized the workbook with a **modular design**, separating data storage, calculations, and presentation into distinct sheets for better clarity and scalability​02_workbook_structure.
- Reduced unnecessary merged cells and frozen panes for smoother navigation and better compatibility with formulas.

#### 4. Data Validation Improvements

- Standardized validations across sheets to ensure accurate data entry and prevent downstream errors.
- Added robust custom validation formulas to validate date formats and zip codes where applicable​03_data_validations.

#### 5. Performance Tuning

- Reduced recalculation overhead by ensuring formulas reference efficient ranges and by removing unused or excessive conditional formatting rules​02_workbook_structure.
- Improved calculation settings to align with workbook usage, optimizing processing times for large datasets.

#### 6. Documentation and Change Tracking

- Created a **change log** to document all updates to formulas, validations, named ranges, and structure, ensuring future users can understand and extend the workbook easily.
- Added clear notes and comments in the workbook to guide users on formulas and named ranges​07_named_ranges.

#### 7. Flexibility for Future Growth

- Added placeholders for future data fields and ensured all dynamic ranges and formulas can accommodate expanding datasets without breaking​07_named_ranges.


-Reorganized the columns in the Opportunities sheet to focus on the the status, stage, close date, added a start date. 

-All sheets with Priority column if the a letter was not entered a message "NO PRIORITY" appears. 

-**Fixed Errors**: Resolved broken formulas, fixed invalid data validations, and corrected named ranges to make everything work smoothly. Example(Fixed unseen #REF! error)

**Improved Performance**: Made formulas faster and cleaned up unnecessary calculations, and ensured the workbook handles larger data without slowing down. (Ex. Removed adv. function that 365 couldn't handle, simplified formulas)

**Simplified Structure**: Organized the workbook to make it easier to use, removed clutter, and prepared it to grow without breaking.( Ex. reorganized columns to be easier to track the current progress, Priority letter missing for Org. will show "NO Priority")
