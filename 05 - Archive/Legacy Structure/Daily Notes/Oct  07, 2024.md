The error you're seeing is caused by incorrect syntax for the file path in your `.spec` file. In Python (and PyInstaller `.spec` files), file paths need to be specified as **strings**, which means they must be enclosed in quotes (`'` or `"`), and backslashes (`\`) in the path should be escaped (using `\\`) or replaced with forward slashes (`/`).

Here's how to fix your `.spec` file:

### Corrected `.spec` File:
```python
# -*- mode: python ; coding: utf-8 -*-

a = Analysis(
    ['main.py'],
    pathex=[],
    binaries=[],
    datas=[('C:\\Users\\revadmin\\Desktop\\Projects\\TranscribeAudio\\.venv\\Lib\\site-packages\\whisper\\assets', 'whisper/assets')],  # Include the Whisper assets here
    hiddenimports=[],
    hookspath=[],
    hooksconfig={},
    runtime_hooks=[],
    excludes=[],
    noarchive=False,
    optimize=0,
)

pyz = PYZ(a.pure)

exe = EXE(
    pyz,
    a.scripts,
    a.binaries,
    a.datas,  # Include the `a.datas` here to ensure assets are copied
    [],
    name='main',
    debug=False,
    bootloader_ignore_signals=False,
    strip=False,
    upx=True,
    upx_exclude=[],
    runtime_tmpdir=None,
    console=True,
    disable_windowed_traceback=False,
    argv_emulation=False,
    target_arch=None,
    codesign_identity=None,
    entitlements_file=None,
)
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
- The path `'C:\\Users\\revadmin\\Desktop\\Projects\\TranscribeAudio\\.venv\\Lib\\site-packages\\whisper\\assets'` is now enclosed in quotes (`'`), making it a proper string.
- Each backslash (`\`) is escaped with another backslash (`\\`) to ensure itâ€™s interpreted correctly as part of the file path in Python.

### Next Steps:
1. Save the updated `.spec` file.
2. Run the PyInstaller command again:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller main.spec
   ```

This should resolve the `SyntaxError` and allow the build process to proceed. Let me know if you encounter any further issues!
