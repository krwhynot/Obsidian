This installation was challenging because the customer, while friendly and patient, requested many system changes and was hard to keep focused during training. This could be a difficult installation for any installer and keep this in mind when reading Kodjo's evaluation.

Technical Knowledge: 
- Kodjo showed strong knowledge of the POS system. He could make changes and answer questions quickly. His notes helped him find solutions when needed. He needs to improve on asking for help when stuck. For example, when a kitchen printer wouldn't connect to the network, he spent too much time trying to fix it alone. The whole installation slowed down until I checked in with him. Told him in the future, he should reach out to the team sooner when facing tough problems or to circle back on the issue but to always keep the install moving forward.

Customer Experience Management:
- Kodjo was always friendly and professional with the customer. His careful work showed that he cared about getting everything right. He needs to improve his communication with customers. He should provide more regular updates about what tasks are finished and what steps come next. Clear, consistent updates would help the customer feel more informed and comfortable about the installation process. 

Adaptive Problem-Solving:
- While Kodjo knows the POS system well, he tends to get too focused on one problem. When he can't solve an issue quickly, he hesitates to ask for help. This causes other tasks to pile up until the original problem is fixed (*follow the 15mins rule*), regardless of how important those other tasks might be. He should work on handling multiple tasks even when one problem remains unsolved and find ways to always keep the installation moving forward.
