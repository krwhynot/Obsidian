Animation System
Responsive Layout System
Drag and Drop Zone with Animation

Based on my research and analysis, here are recommended improvements for the GUI, organized by priority and impact:

1. Modern Design Elements
- Implement a clean, flat design using modern color schemes
- Add subtle animations for user interactions (drag-drop, processing)
- Use consistent spacing and padding throughout the interface
- Implement responsive layouts that adapt to window resizing


2. Enhanced User Experience
- Add a preview area for the input image
- Show real-time thumbnails of output formats as they're generated
- Implement an improved drag-and-drop zone with visual feedback


3. Progress & Feedback
- Add a modern progress bar with percentage completion
- Add error indicators with detailed feedback


4. Format Selection
- Add quick select/deselect all options

5. Technical Improvements
- Use lazy loading for UI components to improve startup time
- Implement proper state management
- Add proper error boundaries around critical components
- Improve memory management for large images
- Add proper logging and telemetry

## Recommendations

### Short-term Actions

1. Consolidate Image Processing:
    - Move common image processing functions to `image_utils.py`
    - Keep only push notification-specific logic in `image_processing.py`
    - Update imports across the project
2. Merge Documentation:
    - Create a single comprehensive image processing guide
    - Structure with clear basic and advanced sections
    - Remove redundant examples

### Long-term Improvements

1. Implement Theme System:
    - Create missing theme implementation files
    - Implement theme loading and application logic
    - Add theme configuration validation
2. Add Missing Tests:
    - Create test files for untested components
    - Ensure comprehensive coverage of core functionality
    - Add integration tests for theme system
3. Complete Error Handling:
    - Implement missing error classes
    - Add error handling for theme configuration
    - Update error documentation
