# MCP Tools for Azure Project Troubleshooting

## Official Microsoft Azure MCP Server

The Azure MCP Server is an official Microsoft implementation that brings Azure capabilities to AI agents like Claude Desktop. It allows you to use Claude AI to interact with Azure resources for key workflows including file storage, database querying, logs analysis, and CLI commands.

### Key Features for Troubleshooting:

1. **Azure Monitor Integration**: Use Kusto Query Language (KQL) to analyze logs and monitor your Azure resources directly through Claude
    
2. **Azure Resource Management**: Query and manage Azure resources through natural language conversations
    
3. **Azure CLI Access**: Execute Azure CLI commands through Claude for troubleshooting
    
4. **Log Analysis**: Retrieve and analyze diagnostic logs to identify issues
    

## Specialized Azure MCP Servers

1. **Azure DevOps MCP Servers**:
    
    - [GitHub - Vortiago/mcp-azure-devops](https://github.com/Vortiago/mcp-azure-devops): Enables AI assistants to interact with Azure DevOps services via Python SDK
    - [GitHub - Tiberriver256/mcp-server-azure-devops](https://github.com/Tiberriver256/mcp-server-azure-devops): Another MCP server specifically for Azure DevOps
2. **Azure CLI MCP**:
    
    - [GitHub - jdubois/azure-cli-mcp](https://github.com/jdubois/azure-cli-mcp): Talk with Azure using MCP through CLI
3. **kalivaraprasad-gonapa/azure-mcp**: A Model Context Protocol implementation that enables Claude Desktop to interact with Azure services, allowing Claude to query and manage Azure resources directly through natural language conversations
    

## Azure-Specific Troubleshooting Capabilities

With these MCP tools, you can perform several troubleshooting tasks:

1. **Diagnostic Analysis**:
    
    - Query diagnostic settings in Azure Monitor
    - Access and analyze log files
    - Review error messages and exceptions
2. **Resource Monitoring**:
    
    - Get real-time metrics on resource usage
    - Set up alerts for potential issues
    - Monitor application performance
3. **Problem Resolution**:
    
    - Execute remediation commands
    - Apply configuration changes
    - Deploy fixes to resources

## How To Get Started

1. **Install Claude Desktop**: This is the recommended client for using MCP servers
    
2. **Install the Azure MCP Server**: You can find the installation instructions and source code at [GitHub - Azure/azure-mcp](https://github.com/Azure/azure-mcp)
    
3. **Configure Authentication**: Set up proper authentication to connect to your Azure resources
    
4. **Start Troubleshooting**: Once configured, you can ask Claude to help diagnose and fix issues in your Azure projects through natural language conversation
    

## Additional Resources

- **Azure AI Foundry Integration**: Microsoft has also created a guide for integrating Azure AI Foundry's Agent Service with Claude Desktop using the Model Context Protocol
    
- **Build MCP Servers with Azure Functions**: For advanced users, there's an experimental preview feature to build your own custom MCP remote servers with Azure Functions
