### **Files to Merge or Remove**

After reviewing the project files, I have identified duplicate functionalities and overlapping responsibilities. Below is a breakdown of which files can be merged or removed for better maintainability.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Merge `image_processing.py` ‚Üí `image_utils.py`**

- **Reason:** `image_processing.py` handles:
    - Processing push notification icons.
    - Image transformations like resizing, contrast analysis, and noise filtering.
- `image_utils.py` already provides utilities for image validation, resizing, and format conversion.
- **Solution:** Move `PushIconProcessor` from `image_processing.py` into `image_utils.py`.

‚úÖ **Action:** **Merge `image_processing.py` into `image_utils.py`** and remove `image_processing.py`.

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Keep `main.py`, `main_window.py`, `config.py`**

- `main.py` is the main entry point of the application. No changes needed.
- `main_window.py` is the main GUI window and depends on `widgets.py` and `config.py`.
- `config.py` will now also store image format configurations (after merging `format.py`).

‚úÖ **Action:** **No changes to `main.py`, `main_window.py`, and `config.py`**.
