3. Researching known solutions
4. Developing and implementing a fix
5. Verifying the resolution

## Required Analysis Steps
* Perform initial problem analysis using `sequentialthinking`
* Check system state:
  - Get file/directory information using `get_file_info`
  - List affected directories with `list_directory`
  - Examine file contents using `read_file` or `read_multiple_files`
  - Search for related files using `search_files`
* Research the error:
  - Use `brave_web_search` to find documented solutions
  - Validate any found solutions against our specific case

## Implementation Authorization
Please:
6. Present your proposed solution before making changes
7. Wait for confirmation before implementing fixes
8. Use appropriate tools for implementation:
   - `create_directory` for new directories
   - `edit_file` or `write_file` for file modifications
   - `move_file` for file operations

## Verification Requirements
* Confirm changes using `get_file_info` or `list_directory`
* Document any modifications made
* Provide steps to validate the fix

## Additional Notes
* If you need clarification on any detail, please ask
* Present intermediate findings before proceeding to next steps
* Flag any potential risks or side effects of proposed solutions
