I'll look into how you can optimize token usage with MCP tools and your Claude configuration by using cache efficiently.

Now let me analyze this information using sequential thinking to provide you with a comprehensive answer about optimizing token usage with MCP tools.

# Optimizing Token Usage with MCP Tools and Cache Utilization

Based on my research and analysis of your Claude configuration file, I can provide you with strategies to minimize token usage through effective cache utilization with your MCP tools.

## Understanding How MCP Reduces Token Usage

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) fundamentally helps reduce token consumption by:

1. **Eliminating redundant data transfer**: Instead of including large amounts of information in your conversation context (which consumes tokens), Claude can access external data sources on demand.

2. **Persistent memory across conversations**: The memory MCP server maintains information between sessions, reducing the need to reintroduce context.

3. **On-demand access to files and information**: Claude can retrieve only what's needed when it's needed, rather than processing everything upfront.

## Optimizing Your Memory MCP Server

Your current memory MCP configuration has several parameters that can be adjusted to improve cache utilization:

```powershell
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory@latest --max-heap-size=2048 --gc-interval=180 --memory-check-interval=30 --max-backup-count=3 --compression-level=3
```

Consider these adjustments:

- **Increase `--max-heap-size`** (currently 2048MB): If your system has additional RAM available, increasing this value will allow more data to be cached.
- **Adjust `--compression-level`** (currently 3): Higher values (up to 9) provide better compression but require more CPU. For token efficiency, consider increasing to 4-5.
- **Fine-tune `--gc-interval`** (currently 180 seconds): Lengthening this interval reduces processing overhead but requires more memory.
- **Optimize `--memory-check-interval`** (currently 30 seconds): Similar to GC interval, balancing this setting affects resource usage.

## File System Optimization Strategies

Your filesystem MCP is configured to access several directories:

```powershell
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem@latest C:\Users\Revadmin\Documents C:\Users\Revadmin\Downloads C:\Users\Revadmin\AppData\Roaming\Claude R:\Projects C:\Users\Revadmin\AppData\Local\npm-cache\_logs
```

To optimize token usage with the filesystem:

1. **Create reference file repositories**: Store frequently used information, code snippets, and reference materials in organized directories that Claude can access.

2. **Use file references instead of content pasting**: Have Claude read from files rather than copying large blocks of text into your conversation.

3. **Implement a structured file naming system**: This makes it easier and more efficient for Claude to locate and access the right files when needed.

## Search Tool Optimization

Your configuration includes both Brave Search and Tavily search tools:

```powershell
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search --max-concurrent-requests=2 --request-timeout=30000
```

To optimize these:

1. **Craft precise search queries**: More specific queries reduce the number of search iterations needed.

2. **Consider increasing `--max-concurrent-requests`** if your system and network can handle it, enabling more parallel searches.

3. **Use search tools for factual information retrieval** rather than having Claude generate content from its training data.

## Performance Configuration Adjustments

In your JSON configuration, you have:

```json
"performance": {
  "enableHardwareAcceleration": true,
  "maxConcurrentOperations": 2,
  "enableMemoryOptimization": true
}
```

Consider these changes:

1. **Increase `maxConcurrentOperations`** to 3-4 if your hardware supports it, allowing more parallel processing.

2. **Add cache-specific parameters** (if not already present in newer versions):
   ```json
   "performance": {
     "enableHardwareAcceleration": true,
     "maxConcurrentOperations": 3,
     "enableMemoryOptimization": true,
     "cacheSettings": {
       "preferCacheReads": true,
       "cacheExpirationTime": 86400,
       "maxCacheSize": 4096
     }
   }
   ```

## Workflow Strategies for Token Efficiency

1. **Use the Memory MCP for contextual information storage**:
   - Store project details, preferences, and frequently referenced context
   - Create entities for recurring topics using the memory MCP's knowledge graph

2. **Leverage Sequential Thinking for complex reasoning**:
   ```powershell
   npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking@latest --max-thoughts=15 --branch-limit=2 --revision-depth=3
   ```
   - This performs reasoning steps externally, reducing token consumption for intermediate thought processes
   - Consider increasing `--max-thoughts` for more complex problems

3. **Build a knowledge graph in the Memory MCP**:
   - Create entities and relationships for frequently discussed topics
   - This creates a structured cache that Claude can efficiently query instead of regenerating information

4. **Use file-based templates and snippets**:
   - Store code templates, document structures, and other reusable content as files
   - Have Claude read and modify these templates rather than generating them from scratch
