You guys are in luck I had a project of my get pushed back and I was able to work on the Workbook for the past day and half. We talked about improving it in 3 ways:

1. Reorganizing the layout of it to make easier to read and more consist for data entering. 
	- I feel this is the most important task to complete as we need all to be on the same page on the type of data is needed and improve the usability. 
2.  Create dashboards and reports focused on principal activity and employee progress.
	- In order to have good reporting we need good data, so I chose to wait until every has agreed on all the types of data and everyone has contributed to the workbook before I start on dashboard and reporting. 
3.  Exploring an option to setup up PIC form for data entry. 
	- I have explore a few options but not sure if they are feasible due to Excel 365(the cloud version) being the primary method of access this workbook. Excel 365 does not allow Macros which is key to creating a PIC form that will be put the data in each spreadsheet. Macros is only available for Excel program running windows. (Sorry not to pick on Apple but Ipads can't run macros). 


 **Reorganized Data**: 
-Made sure all the column followed a similar order as other sheets. 
-Highlighted in light green is now the column the the sheet being focused on.. (Example: Contacts sheet has the column with contact name in light green.)

**Better utilization of Dropdowns:** 
-Created more dropdowns to help keep data consist and more focus on the related data. For example the "State" column has a list of the abbreviate US states
-The "contacts" dropdown in the Interactions sheet will only show names connected to the Operator that is a part of the Interaction record. It pulls these contacts y filter by that Operator in from the Contact Sheet and listing it in the dropdown. 

Data entering is more streamed lined with cells that have formulas to carry same repeated data to other sheets. 

Easier to follow when entering data:
-Column are colored so to know if it is auto completed with a formula(Gray cells) or light blue to signal the cell has a dropdown.
-Notes are placed through out the workbook to help guide the user. 

To ensure the format does not change do to copying and pasting or data accidently being entered in the wrong cells I have locked down most  of the spreadsheets expect for the parts you will need to enter data. If you have a concerns or feel you need to do something I have locked let me know. Also please share any feedback you have on the new format. Is it an improvement to the old one? Anything on the new format you specially over the old one? 

Once I know we all agree on that everything looks good with the data and we have some actual data I will start to work on the Dashboard & Reports.

I want to share that although I have not asked for anything for working on the workbook I am doing it to get experience with working on projects with AI.  I will not bore you with the detail of the stuff I have learned working with AI but I will say that AI has done rough 40-50% of the advance tasks when it comes to working on this workbook.  Some of these tasks it would have taken me a day just to figure it out but took the AI just minutes to show/tech me and complete it. Although I enjoy the experience and helping family if at the end of this I was given an VIsa Gift card to help continue my learning with AI, I would not turn it down. 


I wanted to share the exciting updates to our workbook. After a day and a half of focused work, we've transformed it into a more user-friendly and efficient tool.

The workbook now features:

- A standardized column layout across all sheets, making navigation natural and data entry smoother. Each related section follows the same pattern, so you'll find familiar information right where you expect it.
- Smart dropdowns that connect our data:
    - State selections now include a full list of US state abbreviations, eliminating the need to remember or look up the correct format
    - Contact lists automatically update when you select an operator - you'll only see contacts linked to that specific operator, making selections quicker and more relevant
    - Each dropdown acts as a built-in data validator, preventing inconsistencies like misspellings, extra spaces, or varying formats that could affect our reporting
    - This connected system means changes in one place update everywhere, keeping our data synchronized
- Visual guides through color-coding:
    - Light green highlights the primary focus columns in each sheet (like contact names in the Contacts sheet), drawing your attention to the most important information
    - Gray-colored cells contain formulas that automatically calculate or pull data from other sheets - no need to enter this information manually
    - Light blue signals dropdown menus, showing you exactly where you can select from pre-set options
    - The color system creates an intuitive workflow - you can quickly spot which cells need your input and which ones will populate automatically
    - This visual organization reduces confusion and speeds up data entry
- Sheet protection that:
    - Safeguards our critical formulas and calculations from being accidentally overwritten or deleted during routine data entry
    - Leaves data entry cells fully accessible while protecting the workbook's structure and functionality
    - Preserves our formatting choices like column widths, cell colors, and dropdown menus
    - Creates a more stable workbook that can handle multiple users without breaking
    About the Excel PIC form: I explored options for building a Personnel In Charge (PIC) data entry form directly in Excel. Unfortunately, Excel 365's cloud version doesn't support the macros needed to create these custom entry forms. This limitation affects both cloud users and iPad users, so we'll need to explore other options for streamlined data entry.

Looking ahead:

- The dashboard and reporting features will come next
- We'll build these once we've collected some real data
- This approach ensures our reports show exactly what you need

Your turn:

- Take the workbook for a test drive
- Share what you like about the new format
- Let me know if any protected areas need adjusting
- Point out anything that could work better for you
