```

10. Documentation Prompts:
```
- "Can you help create a documentation template for the project?"
- "What should be included in the API documentation?"
- "How should we document the database schema and relationships?"
```

Tips for Writing Effective Prompts:
1. Be specific about what you need
2. Include relevant constraints or requirements
3. Mention which component you're focusing on
4. Ask for examples when appropriate
5. Request step-by-step explanations for complex topics

Example of a Well-Structured Prompt:
```
"I'm working on implementing the audio processing engine for CHAT. Can you help me design 
a memory-efficient system that can:
1. Handle files up to 2GB
2. Process audio in chunks
3. Maintain progress tracking
4. Implement proper error handling

Please include code examples and explain any important considerations for GPU vs CPU processing."
```
