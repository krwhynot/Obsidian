I like to do the following in this order:
	1.  Process improvement and optimization
	2. Training and mentoring team members
	3.Creating technical documentation and guides
	4. Direct customer interaction 
	5.  Problem-solving complex technical issues

I develop tools and utilities to assist in the process of automation

my ideal next position would combine both technical and leadership responsibilities more of a focus on technical 

Less database and more in cloud
