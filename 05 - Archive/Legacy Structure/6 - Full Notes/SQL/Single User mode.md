# Emergency SQL Server Single User Mode Resolution Guide

## Overview
This procedure should only be executed when unable to exit single user mode through SQL Server Management Studio's standard interface.

## Prerequisites
- Administrative access to Command Prompt
- SQL Server Management Studio must be closed
- SQL Server service must be running

## Resolution Command
```sql
sqlcmd -S Revent1\Revention -d master -Q "ALTER DATABASE [Revention] SET SINGLE_USER WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE; ALTER DATABASE [Revention] SET MULTI_USER;"
```

## Process Termination
If the command fails to execute:

1. Open Task Manager
2. Navigate to Details tab
3. Locate and terminate `sqlservr.exe` processes
4. Retry the resolution command

## Verification
Confirm successful mode change:
```sql
sqlcmd -S Revent1\Revention -d master -Q "SELECT name, user_access_desc FROM sys.databases WHERE name = 'Revention'"
```

## Important Notes
- Use this method only as a last resort
- Document any terminated processes
- Verify database functionality after mode change
