# Inbox Usage Guide

*Quick capture area for all incoming thoughts, ideas, and information*

## Purpose
The inbox serves as your immediate capture zone for anything that needs to be processed later. During field work, coding sessions, or daily life, quickly capture information here without worrying about organization. Process items regularly to move them to appropriate locations.

## Quick Capture Guidelines

### Field Service Captures
- **Urgent issues**: `urgent-[restaurant-name]-[date].md`
- **Installation notes**: `install-[restaurant-name]-[date].md`
- **Technical discoveries**: `tech-solution-[brief-description].md`

### Coding Captures
- **Bug solutions**: `bug-fix-[brief-description]-[date].md`
- **Learning moments**: `learned-[concept]-[date].md`
- **Project ideas**: `idea-[project-concept]-[date].md`

### Job Search Captures
- **Job opportunities**: `job-[company-name]-[date].md`
- **Networking contacts**: `contact-[person-name]-[context].md`
- **Interview insights**: `interview-[company]-[date].md`

### General Captures
- **Random ideas**: `idea-[brief-description]-[date].md`

## Processing Schedule

### Daily (End of day - 5 minutes)

### Weekly (Friday - 15 minutes)
- Process all remaining items

- Plan next week's priorities based on captures

## File Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with hyphens
- Include date for time-sensitive items: `YYYY-MM-DD`
- Start with category prefix for quick identification
- Keep names descriptive but brief

## Common Processing Destinations
- **Project work** → `01 - Projects/[relevant project]/`
- **Reference material** → `03 - Resources/[appropriate category]/`
- **Learning concepts** → `04 - Zettelkasten/Permanent Notes/` (as ZK-###)
- **Daily activities** → `04 - Zettelkasten/Daily Notes/`
- **Completed work** → `05 - Archive/`

## Voice Memo Workflow
1. Record voice memo during field work
2. Create placeholder file: `voice-memo-[topic]-[date].md`
3. Add brief note about voice memo content
4. Process during daily inbox review
5. Transcribe important information to appropriate location
6. Delete voice memo placeholder after processing

## Mobile Capture Tips
- Use voice-to-text for quick captures while driving
- Take photos with descriptive names for visual information
- Use simple, searchable keywords
- Process mobile captures as soon as possible

Remember: The inbox is for capture, not storage. Keep it flowing!
