# ZK-004: Inventory Management Integration

*Inventory systems must seamlessly integrate with POS transactions to provide real-time stock tracking, automatic reorder triggers, and accurate cost calculations.*

Modern restaurant POS systems require sophisticated inventory integration that goes beyond simple stock counting. The system must track ingredient usage per menu item, handle complex recipes with multiple components, manage vendor relationships, and provide real-time cost analysis. This integration affects everything from menu pricing to staff workflows and directly impacts restaurant profitability through waste reduction and optimal ordering.

## Key Insights
- Inventory integration success depends on accurate recipe management and consistent staff usage tracking
- Real-time inventory updates require careful database design to handle high-frequency transaction processing
- Integration complexity scales with menu complexity - simple items vs. complex recipes with multiple components

## Real-World Applications
- **In field service**: Configuring inventory modules, training staff on proper usage tracking, troubleshooting sync issues between POS and inventory systems
- **In coding**: Designing database schemas for inventory tracking, implementing API integrations with suppliers, building reporting dashboards
- **In career development**: Shows understanding of business operations, data modeling, and system integration challenges

## Examples
**Concrete Example 1**: Pizza restaurant where each pizza order automatically deducts flour, cheese, and toppings based on recipe definitions, with alerts when ingredients fall below reorder thresholds
**Concrete Example 2**: Bar integration where cocktail orders deduct specific alcohol amounts, track pour costs, and generate variance reports for loss prevention

## Questions & Extensions
- How do different inventory valuation methods (FIFO, LIFO, weighted average) impact POS integration?
- What are the challenges of integrating with multiple supplier ordering systems?
- How should inventory systems handle waste, comps, and other non-sale inventory adjustments?
