# ZK-025: Test-Driven Development Principles

*Test-driven development creates better software by writing tests first, driving design decisions through testability requirements*

Test-driven development (TDD) reverses traditional development by writing failing tests before implementing functionality. This approach forces developers to think about requirements, interfaces, and expected behavior before writing code, leading to more focused, testable, and maintainable software. The red-green-refactor cycle creates a safety net that enables confident code changes and system evolution.

TDD parallels field service diagnostic procedures where verification steps are planned before beginning work. Just as technicians confirm system functionality after each installation step, TDD confirms code functionality after each development increment. This systematic verification approach prevents integration issues and creates living documentation of system behavior.

## Key Insights
- Writing tests first clarifies requirements and expected behavior before implementation
- Small, focused tests enable confident refactoring and system changes
- Test failures provide immediate feedback on code changes and system integration
- TDD naturally leads to better code design through testability requirements

## Real-World Applications
- **In field service**: Verification procedures planned and executed at each installation step
- **In coding**: Systematic testing approach ensuring code reliability and maintainability
- **In career development**: Demonstrates professional software development practices and quality focus

**Concrete Example 2**: Creating test for POS payment processing before building payment integration, verifying expected inputs and outputs

## Questions & Extensions
- How does TDD apply to different types of software (web, mobile, embedded systems)?
- What are the trade-offs between TDD and other testing approaches in different project contexts?
- How can TDD principles apply to non-coding activities like system configuration or process design?

## Sources & Learning
- Professional software development best practices
- TDD methodology documentation and case studies
