# ZK-002: Client-Server Architecture Concepts

*Client-server architecture separates presentation logic from business logic, enabling scalable system design*

Client-server architecture divides applications into two distinct components: clients that request services and servers that provide those services. This separation enables better resource utilization, centralized data management, and system scalability. In restaurant environments, this translates to POS terminals (clients) communicating with central servers that handle business logic, payment processing, and data storage.

The key advantage is centralized controlâ€”all business rules, data validation, and critical operations occur on the server, ensuring consistency across all client interactions. However, this creates a dependency on network connectivity and server availability that can impact operations when infrastructure fails.

## Key Insights
- Separation of concerns improves system maintainability and scalability
- Network reliability becomes critical for system functionality
- Centralized business logic ensures data consistency and security
- Server performance directly impacts all connected clients

## Real-World Applications
- **In field service**: Understanding client-server relationships helps diagnose connectivity issues and optimize network performance
- **In coding**: Web applications follow similar patterns with browsers as clients and web servers providing services
- **In career development**: Demonstrates understanding of fundamental system architecture principles

## Examples
**Concrete Example 1**: Restaurant POS system where terminals request menu data from central server, ensuring all locations have consistent pricing and availability
**Concrete Example 2**: Web application where browser requests data from API server, separating user interface from business logic and database operations

## Questions & Extensions
- How do modern microservices architectures extend traditional client-server patterns?
- What are the trade-offs between thick clients vs. thin clients in different scenarios?
- How do offline capabilities change the client-server relationship?
