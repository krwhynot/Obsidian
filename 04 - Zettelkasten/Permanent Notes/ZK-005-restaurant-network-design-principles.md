# ZK-005: Restaurant Network Design Principles

*Restaurant networks require high reliability, segregated traffic, and performance optimization for operational continuity*

Restaurant network design differs from typical business networks due to unique operational requirements: point-of-sale transactions cannot tolerate delays, kitchen operations need real-time communication, and customer WiFi must be separated from business systems. The network becomes critical infrastructure that directly impacts revenue generation and customer experience.

Key design principles include network segmentation (separating POS, kitchen, and guest networks), redundancy for critical systems, bandwidth allocation prioritizing business operations, and physical infrastructure considerations for harsh kitchen environments. Unlike office networks, restaurant networks must operate reliably during peak service periods when failure means immediate revenue loss.

## Key Insights
- Network uptime directly correlates with restaurant revenue potential
- Proper segmentation protects business systems from guest network issues
- Physical environment considerations (heat, moisture, space) affect equipment placement
- Peak-time performance requirements exceed typical business network demands

## Real-World Applications
- **In field service**: Network design knowledge enables optimal POS system placement and configuration
- **In coding**: Understanding network requirements helps design resilient applications
- **In career development**: Demonstrates systems thinking and infrastructure planning skills

## Examples
**Concrete Example 1**: Segregated VLAN setup with POS systems on dedicated network, kitchen displays on operations network, and guest WiFi on isolated network
**Concrete Example 2**: Redundant internet connections with automatic failover to ensure POS operations continue during primary connection outages

## Questions & Extensions
