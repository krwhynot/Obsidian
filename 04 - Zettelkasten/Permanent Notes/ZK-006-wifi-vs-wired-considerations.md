# ZK-006: WiFi vs Wired Considerations

*Network infrastructure decisions in restaurant environments must balance mobility, reliability, security, and cost while supporting mission-critical POS operations.*

Restaurant networking requires careful consideration of when to use WiFi versus wired connections. While WiFi offers mobility and easier installation, wired connections provide superior reliability, security, and performance for critical systems. The decision impacts everything from payment processing reliability to staff productivity and customer experience. Modern restaurants often require a hybrid approach with strategic placement of both connection types.

## Key Insights
- POS terminals handling payments should prioritize wired connections for reliability and PCI compliance
- WiFi is ideal for mobile devices, tablets, and non-critical systems but requires robust security configuration
- Network segmentation becomes crucial when mixing WiFi and wired devices in the same environment

## Real-World Applications
- **In field service**: Assessing site conditions, running cable for critical systems, configuring secure WiFi networks for tablets and mobile devices
- **In coding**: Implementing network failover logic, building applications that handle connectivity changes, designing offline-capable systems
- **In career development**: Demonstrates networking knowledge, security awareness, and practical problem-solving skills

## Examples
**Concrete Example 1**: POS terminal at server station uses wired connection for payment processing reliability, while handheld ordering devices use WiFi for mobility during table service
**Concrete Example 2**: Kitchen display systems use wired connections for consistent order receipt, while management tablets use WiFi for flexibility in inventory and reporting tasks

## Questions & Extensions
- How do different WiFi standards (802.11n, ac, ax) affect restaurant POS performance?
- What are the cost implications of running cable vs. WiFi infrastructure in different building types?
- How should network redundancy be implemented for critical POS functions?
