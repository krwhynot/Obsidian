# ZK-018: Customer Service to Stakeholder Management

*Customer service skills in field service directly translate to stakeholder management in software development through communication, expectation management, and problem-solving approaches.*

The transition from customer service to stakeholder management involves applying interpersonal skills in new contexts. Field service customer interactions focus on immediate problem resolution, clear communication about technical issues, and managing expectations during system implementations. Software development stakeholder management uses similar skills for requirements gathering, progress communication, technical explanation to non-technical audiences, and managing competing priorities across different business units.

## Key Insights
- Technical communication skills are transferable - explaining POS issues prepares you for explaining software architecture
- Expectation management is crucial in both contexts - under-promise and over-deliver applies universally
- Problem-solving approaches that work with restaurant managers also work with product managers and business stakeholders

## Real-World Applications
- **In field service**: Managing restaurant owner expectations during POS installations, communicating technical constraints clearly, building long-term client relationships
- **In coding**: Gathering requirements from business stakeholders, communicating development progress, explaining technical limitations and trade-offs
- **In career development**: Demonstrates interpersonal skills, business acumen, and ability to work across different organizational levels
