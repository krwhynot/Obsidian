# ZK-003: Payment Processing Workflow

*Payment processing systems require secure, real-time transaction handling with multiple integration points and fallback mechanisms.*

Payment processing in restaurant POS systems involves a complex workflow that must handle credit cards, cash, mobile payments, and various tender types while maintaining security compliance (PCI DSS) and providing real-time authorization. The workflow includes pre-authorization, capture, settlement, and reconciliation phases, each with specific technical requirements and potential failure points that must be anticipated and handled gracefully.

## Key Insights
- Payment processing is never just about the transaction - it's about data security, compliance, and customer experience
- Real-time processing requires robust fallback mechanisms for network failures or gateway issues
- Integration complexity increases exponentially with each payment method added to the system

## Real-World Applications
- **In field service**: Configuring payment terminals, troubleshooting EMV chip reader issues, setting up mobile payment acceptance
- **In coding**: Implementing secure API calls, handling asynchronous payment responses, building transaction logging systems
- **In career development**: Demonstrates understanding of financial systems, security protocols, and integration architecture

## Connections
- **Builds on**: [[ZK-001-pos-system-architecture-fundamentals]] - Payment processing is a critical subsystem
- **Relates to**: [[ZK-002-client-server-architecture-concepts]] - Payments require secure client-server communication
- **Applied in**: [[02 - Areas/Restaurant POS Systems/Knowledge Base/Installation Steps]] - Payment setup is part of every installation
- **Leads to**: [[ZK-004-inventory-management-integration]] - Payments trigger inventory updates

## Examples
**Concrete Example 1**: HungerRush EMV integration where chip reader communicates with payment processor, requires network connectivity, and falls back to manual entry if chip fails
**Concrete Example 2**: Mobile payment (Apple Pay/Google Pay) requiring NFC hardware, tokenization, and real-time authorization with instant customer feedback

## Questions & Extensions
- How do different payment processors handle tokenization and what are the security implications?
- What are the performance implications of synchronous vs asynchronous payment processing?
- How should payment failures be communicated to both staff and customers?

## Sources & Learning
- Field experience with HungerRush payment terminal installations
- PCI DSS compliance requirements documentation
- Payment processor API documentation (various vendors)
