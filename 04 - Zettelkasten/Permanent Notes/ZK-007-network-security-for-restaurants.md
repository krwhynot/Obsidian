# ZK-007: Network Security for Restaurants

*Restaurant network security must protect payment data, customer information, and business operations while maintaining usability for staff and guest access.*

Restaurant network security presents unique challenges due to the need to handle sensitive payment data (PCI DSS compliance), protect customer information, maintain operational systems, and often provide guest WiFi access. The security model must segment these different use cases while remaining simple enough for restaurant staff to manage. This requires careful VLAN configuration, firewall rules, and monitoring systems that can detect anomalies without disrupting service.

## Key Insights
- Network segmentation is critical - payment systems, operational systems, and guest access should never share the same network segment
- Security must be simple enough for restaurant managers to understand and maintain, not just IT professionals
- Compliance requirements (PCI DSS) drive many security decisions but shouldn't be the only consideration

## Real-World Applications
- **In field service**: Configuring VLANs, setting up firewall rules, implementing secure WiFi with multiple SSIDs for different access levels
- **In coding**: Building security monitoring tools, implementing network access controls, creating automated compliance reporting
- **In career development**: Shows security awareness, compliance knowledge, and ability to balance security with operational needs

## Connections
- **Builds on**: [[ZK-006-wifi-vs-wired-considerations]] - Connection types affect security implementation
- **Relates to**: [[ZK-005-restaurant-network-design-principles]] - Security requirements influence network topology
- **Applied in**: [[02 - Areas/Restaurant POS Systems/Knowledge Base/New Station Image/Firewall/]] - Firewall configuration is part of every installation
- **Leads to**: [[ZK-008-bandwidth-requirements-analysis]] - Security measures can impact network performance

## Examples
**Concrete Example 1**: Three-tier network with isolated POS VLAN, staff operational VLAN, and guest WiFi VLAN, each with different firewall rules and access controls
**Concrete Example 2**: PCI DSS compliant setup where payment terminals can only communicate with payment processor and local server, with all other traffic blocked

## Questions & Extensions
- How do different firewall vendors handle restaurant-specific security requirements?
- What are the emerging threats specific to restaurant technology environments?
- How should security monitoring be implemented without overwhelming restaurant staff?
