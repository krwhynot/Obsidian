# ZK-008: Bandwidth Requirements Analysis

*Restaurant network bandwidth planning must account for POS traffic, cloud services, payment processing, security systems, and guest access while maintaining performance during peak hours.*

Bandwidth planning for restaurants involves complex calculations that go beyond simple user counts. POS systems generate constant small transactions, cloud-based services require consistent upload/download capacity, payment processing needs guaranteed availability, and guest WiFi can consume significant bandwidth. The analysis must consider peak dining hours, seasonal variations, and growth projections while ensuring mission-critical systems always have priority access.

## Key Insights
- POS systems generate high-frequency, low-bandwidth traffic that requires consistent latency rather than high throughput
- Cloud services and backup systems need substantial upload bandwidth, often overlooked in planning
- Guest WiFi can consume unpredictable amounts of bandwidth and should be isolated with traffic shaping

## Real-World Applications
- **In field service**: Calculating required internet speeds, configuring QoS policies, troubleshooting performance issues during busy periods
- **In coding**: Building network monitoring tools, implementing bandwidth usage analytics, creating automated scaling solutions
- **In career development**: Demonstrates analytical thinking, understanding of network performance, and capacity planning skills

## Examples
**Concrete Example 1**: 100-seat restaurant needs 50Mbps for POS operations, 20Mbps for cloud backups, 100Mbps for guest WiFi, with QoS ensuring POS always gets priority
**Concrete Example 2**: Multi-location chain requires VPN connectivity between sites, adding overhead calculations and redundancy planning to bandwidth analysis

## Questions & Extensions
- How do different POS systems vary in their bandwidth requirements and traffic patterns?
- What are the implications of ISP service level agreements on restaurant operations?
- How should bandwidth planning account for future technology adoption (IoT devices, video analytics, etc.)?
