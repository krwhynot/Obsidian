<Task> Optimize a Markdown file for Claude Code AI parsing and comprehension. </Task> 
<Inputs>/home/krwhynot/Projects/KitchenPantry/Docs/Performance Optimization and Monitoring.md</Inputs> 
<Instructions> You are provided with a Markdown file named `<filename>`. Your task is to optimize this file for **Claude Code AI** by applying Claude-friendly formatting and — if necessary — breaking it into smaller, modular files.

Please follow the guidelines below:
1. If the file exceeds **2,000–4,000 tokens**, split it into multiple `.md` files.
    
2. Each new file should reside in a **new folder** and be logically named based on its content (e.g., `auth_strategies.md`, `rate_limiting.md`).
    
3. Apply the following formatting standards across all files:    
    - Use `##` and `###` headers to organize concepts clearly        
    - Keep individual sections **under 400 tokens**        
    - Use **bullet points**, **bolded key terms**, and **well-formatted code blocks**       
    - Begin complex sections with a **brief 1–2 sentence summary**        
    - Avoid **inline images**, **raw HTML**, or excessive nesting
        

Output clean, Claude Code–ready Markdown content inside the new modular structure.
