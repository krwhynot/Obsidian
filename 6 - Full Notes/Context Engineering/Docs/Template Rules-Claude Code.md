Rewrite this  Database Schema and Data Models.md file that thoroughly documents the projectâ€™s authentication and security mechanisms, optimized for Claude Code AI parsing and comprehension.

If the file exceeds 2,000â€“4,000 tokens, break it down into modular Markdown files to maintain optimal Claude compatibility.

ðŸ§  Claude-Friendly Formatting Rules:
Use ## and ### headers to organize concepts clearly
Keep individual sections under 400 tokens for focused context chunks
Use bullet points, bolded key terms, and well-indented code blocks
Start complex sections with a brief 1â€“2 sentence summary
Avoid inline images, raw HTML, or excessive nesting



ðŸ“„ Each relevant part should include:
Clear TypeScript examples (e.g. token validation middleware)
Practical code snippets or configs (e.g. helmet, cors, bcrypt)
Error patterns (e.g. 401, 403 responses) and how to handle them
Short integration examples where relevant (login flow, token exchange)

Deliver clean Markdown output optimized for Claude Code AI to parse efficiently and maintain context over multi-part implementations.
