Create a `UI_UX_doc.md` file for this project that is optimized for Claude Code AI’s contextual understanding.

The file should follow Claude-friendly formatting standards to ensure clarity, parsing efficiency, and effective code AI utilization.

**If the content exceeds optimal context length**, break it into clearly named multiple Markdown files (e.g. `UI_components.md`, `Accessibility_standards.md`, etc.) to preserve full fidelity without loss of detail.

Please structure each file using these best practices:

- Use **clear section headers** (`##`, `###`)    
- Keep individual sections **under ~400 tokens**    
- Use **bullet points or numbered lists** rather than dense paragraphs    
- Emphasize key points with **bold** or _italic_ text    
- Begin complex sections with a **1–2 sentence summary**    
- Avoid embedded images, raw HTML, or overly nested formatting    

The documentation must include the following sections (split into separate files if needed):

- **Design System Specifications**    
- **UI Component Guidelines*    
- **User Experience Flow Diagrams** (textual summaries)    
- **Responsive Design Requirements**    
- **Accessibility Standards*    
- **Style Guide and Branding**    
- **Component Library Organization**    
- **User Journey Maps**    
- **Wireframe References**    
- **Design Tool Integration Instructions**
    

Output everything as clean, semantic Markdown, ready for Claude Code AI consumption.
