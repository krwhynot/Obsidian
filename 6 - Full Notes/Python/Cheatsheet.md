 **go to the last published Git Push:**  
git checkout .
git clean -fd

 
 python -m logocraft.main

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
**PS C:\Users\revadmin\Desktop\Projects\LogoCraft_App>**
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create necessary directories
mkdir logs
mkdir output

# Initialize git repository
git add .
git commit -m "Initial project setup with basic structure and configuration"


I'll modify the script to address the issues you're experiencing. There are three main problems:

1. Unicode emoji characters causing encoding errors
2. HTML report generation configuration
3. Test execution issues

Here's an updated `run_tests.py`:

Let's also update the `requirements.txt` to ensure all necessary packages are installed:

FOR TESTING

### Recommended Execution Steps

1. **Recreate Virtual Environment** (Optional but recommended)
   ```powershell
   # Remove existing virtual environment
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .venv

   # Create new virtual environment
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\Activate
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run Tests**
   ```powershell
   python run_tests.py
   ```

### Debugging Test Failures

If tests are failing, here are some steps to diagnose:

1. **Verbose Test Running**
   ```powershell
   # Run specific test file with full output
   pytest tests/test_error_handling.py -v
   ```

2. **Check Test Implementation**
   - Ensure all imports are correct
   - Verify test dependencies
   - Check for any environment-specific issues

Would you like me to help you debug any specific test failures or explain the test execution process in more detail?


If you want to make the branch match the **"removed some notes"** commit, discarding later changes:

1. **Copy the Commit ID**:
    
    - Right-click the commit and select **"Copy Commit ID"**.
2. **Open the Terminal in VS Code**:
    
    - Use the following command to reset:
        - **Hard Reset (discard changes)**:
            
            bash
            
            CopyEdit
            
            `git reset --hard <commit-id>`
            
            This will roll back to the selected commit and discard all changes after it.
        - **Soft Reset (keep changes staged)**:
            
            bash
            
            CopyEdit
            
            `git reset --soft <commit-id>`
            
            This will undo commits but keep changes staged for a new commit.
3. If you used a **hard reset**, youâ€™re done.  
    If you used a **soft reset**, you can commit your changes again or modify them.
