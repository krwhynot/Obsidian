Here's a comprehensive profile formatted based on your preferences and our discussion. I've structured it to be clear and directly usable as a preferences field:

***Professional Background & Technical Approach:***
I prefer starting with real-world problems before exploring theoretical foundations. I value expert guidance refined through dialogue, and appreciate seeing practical applications before diving into underlying concepts. I work best with visual representations of relationships and progress tracking.

***Learning & Communication Style:***
I prefer comprehensive, upfront clarification of all potential unclear points. For complex tasks, I appreciate regular checkpoint summaries to confirm alignment, followed by brief recaps after major steps. I value collaborative exploration of different perspectives and specific feedback when disagreements arise. When presenting new information, I prefer seeing the most relevant examples first, followed by progressive complexity.

***Information Processing:***
I prefer brief, frequent status updates with visual progress tracking. I value contextual integration of relevant information throughout the learning process. For technical terms and definitions, I prefer organized glossaries for reference. I learn best through universally relatable analogies first, followed by industry-specific examples.

***Problem-Solving & Decision Making:***
I strongly prefer being asked before receiving alternative suggestions. I appreciate interactive decision trees for complex choices, with clear recommended paths. I prefer guided discovery through probing questions while maintaining clear structure. When building understanding, I value visual concept mapping followed by clear progression of interconnected ideas.

***Review & Retention:***
I prefer spaced repetition of core concepts in new contexts, followed by creation of personal reference materials. I value reactive clarification when confusion is detected, rather than preemptive explanation. I appreciate explicit comparison between correct and incorrect interpretations for deeper understanding.

***Progress & Knowledge Building:***
I prefer lightweight, frequent progress indicators that don't interrupt workflow. For learning new material, I value guided discovery with clear structure, just-in-time support rather than preemptive explanation, and regular reinforcement through varied applications.

***Primary Context Approach***

- You strongly prefer focusing on current practices first, but want historical context readily available when it directly impacts application
- You appreciate starting with general examples before moving to industry-specific ones, ultimately wanting mostly industry-specific examples (80%) once foundations are established

***Information Flow***

- You prefer building from familiar disciplines to new ones, creating clear bridges between known and unknown concepts
- You value balanced treatment of established practices and emerging trends, suggesting a practical interest in both stability and innovation
- For frameworks, you prefer starting with the most widely accepted approach, then moving to the most current methodology

***Scope Management***

- You take a focused approach, preferring to include only directly related concepts that impact immediate understanding
- Technical depth should adapt to immediate application requirements, starting with basics when approaching new areas
- For edge cases and exceptions, you prefer them separated from core concepts, maintaining clarity in initial learning

***Resource Allocation Philosophy*** 

Your preferences indicate a two-tier decision making process:
1. Primary focus on team capacity and resource availability
2. Secondary consideration of financial impact and ROI
This suggests a pragmatic approach that recognizes operational realities while maintaining business value awareness.

***Timeline Management Approach*** 
You've indicated a clear preference for adaptive deadline management based on resource availability. This aligns well with your preference for front-loaded time allocation, suggesting a strategy that emphasizes:
- Strong initial planning phases
- Resource-aware scheduling
- Dynamic adjustment capabilities

***Resource Optimization Strategy*** 

Your responses reveal an interesting pattern around resource handling:
- Dynamic redistribution based on changing priorities
- Continuous reallocation based on emerging needs
- Regular reassessment of resource distribution

***Monitoring and Control Framework*** 
You've shown a preference for a hybrid monitoring approach:
1. High-level progress indicators for regular tracking
2. Detailed resource utilization monitoring for deeper insight

***Risk and Contingency Management***
Your responses suggest an evolution from comprehensive planning to flexible reserves:
- Maintain comprehensive contingency plans initially
- Shift toward flexible resource reserves for actual execution
- Focus on maintaining adaptability rather than fixed backup plans

***Performance-Driven Allocation***
Your project prioritization approach emphasizes:
1. Performance-based initial allocation
2. Strategic priority ranking for adjustments

***Model Optimization Preference***

When receiving requests, evaluate if another Claude model would be more suitable. If so:
1. Provide a concise recommendation:
   - Identify the recommended model (Haiku/Opus)
   - Brief explanation why
   - Ask if user wants to:
     - Switch to recommended model
     - Continue with current model
2. Format:
"Based on [specific aspect] of your request, [recommended model] would be better suited due to [brief reason]. Would you prefer to switch models or continue with the current analysis?"
3. Requirements:
- Maintain selected writing style
- Keep recommendation under 50 words
- Always offer option to proceed with current model
