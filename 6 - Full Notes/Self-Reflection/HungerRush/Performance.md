**Performance - "The What"**
In 2024, I achieved several major goals that demonstrate my strong performance. Most notably, I completed a record number of 87 installations this year - a personal best for me - and customers were consistently happy with my work, proactively sending in positive feedback about their experience. One of my biggest accomplishments was updating equipment at 13 I Fratellis' locations in just two and a half weeks, showing I can handle large, urgent projects well.

I also focused on helping my teammates grow and succeed. I trained Anthony Tes from our Marketing team on how to handle RM flips, and I helped prepare our new 3rd party technicians to install our equipment correctly. 

When urgent issues came up, I volunteered last minute to visit three different customer sites to help our Customer Success team solve ongoing problems. This extra effort helped make sure our customers stayed satisfied with our service.

Looking ahead, I want to focus on two key areas for growth. 
	- I plan to create simple troubleshooting guides based on my experience, which will help our team maintain consistent quality across all installations. . 
	- I'll work on providing more regular and detailed updates during projects to keep everyone informed and aligned.

**Values - "The How"**
Throughout 2024, I showed my commitment to HungerRush's TRACS values in my daily work. I really focused on being fast and efficient while keeping our customers happy. This shows in the 87 installations I completed this year and in the positive feedback I received from many customers who were pleased with my service.

I also worked hard to be a good team player and take responsibility for my work. I helped our Sales team at the big NRA show in Chicago, and I made sure to be available after regular work hours to help other installers when they needed support through Teams. When challenges came up, I tackled them head-on. For example, when the CSM team needed urgent help at Reginellis Lakeview location, I worked closely with our Engineering and Development teams to fix some tricky tablet setup issues before leaving the site.

To improve in the future, I want to find better ways to share my knowledge and experience with the team. While I currently help others through quick guidance and providing positive feedback on Lattice, I could develop more organized ways to train and support my colleagues. This would help everyone learn faster and work more efficiently.

**Overall Annual Performance**

I consistently demonstrate excellence across all our TRACS values in my daily work. As a team player, I go above and beyond my regular duties to help HungerRush succeed. This shows in how I handle equipment replacements - I don't just report issues, I personally follow up to ensure overnight shipping and minimize customer downtime. I show respect for my colleagues by making myself available for urgent support, whether it's helping customers or fellow team members who need guidance.

My accountability and commitment to customer success is reflected in the quality of my work. Many customers have sent in positive feedback, and several have specifically requested me for their future installations. This kind of feedback is particularly meaningful because it shows I'm living up to our values of creating raving fans while taking ownership of my work. I demonstrate speed through my record-breaking number of installations and quick response to urgent needs, proving that I understand the importance of being responsive and efficient.

Looking ahead, I've helped strengthen our team by training new outside technicians, showing my commitment to our growth and success. This work is crucial as it helps us handle more installations as our company expands. I plan to maintain this high level of performance while developing even better ways to share my knowledge with the team. By working together more effectively, we can all contribute to creating outstanding customer experiences and driving HungerRush's continued success.
