## Project Guide
Projects allow you to ground Claude’s outputs in your internal knowledge—be it style guides, codebases, interview transcripts, or past work. This added context enables Claude to provide expert assistance across tasks, from writing emails like your marketing team to writing SQL queries like a data analyst.

Project instructions help Claude understand the specific context and requirements for a particular project. These instructions only apply to chats within that project.

Use Project Instructions when you want to:

- Provide project-specific context    
- Set guidelines for a particular workflow    
- Establish requirements for a specific set of tasks    
- Define roles or perspectives Claude should adopt within the project
    
Project instructions are particularly useful when you're working on focused tasks or need Claude to maintain consistent context across multiple conversations within the same project.
