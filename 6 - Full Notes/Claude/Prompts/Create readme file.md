**Task:**  
Create a detailed README file that outlines the order of operations for the system, specifying which files it utilizes and describing the functions in each file.

**Requirements:**

1. **Order of Operations**
    
    - Clearly describe the sequence in which files are accessed and utilized during execution.
    - Explain dependencies between files and their execution flow.
2. **File Descriptions**
    
    - List each file with its **full file path**.
    - Provide a summary of its purpose.
    - Detail the key functions it contains, their roles, and how they contribute to the system.
3. **Output Format**
    
    - Use a structured format, such as:
        
        ```markdown
        ## Order of Operations
        1. File A (`/path/to/fileA`): [Description]
           - Function 1: [Purpose]
           - Function 2: [Purpose]
        2. File B (`/path/to/fileB`): [Description]
           - Function 3: [Purpose]
        ```
        
    - Optionally include code snippets or examples where relevant.

**Additional Context:**

- Assume the audience has **technical expertise** and is familiar with the programming environment but may not be aware of the specific implementation details.
- Maintain clarity and conciseness while ensuring completeness.
