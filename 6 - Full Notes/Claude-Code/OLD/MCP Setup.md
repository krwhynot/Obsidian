MCP Auto-Setup Complete!

  I've created a comprehensive MCP setup system for your PantryCRM project:

  🚀 Quick Commands Added:

  - npm run setup:mcp (Linux/Mac/WSL)
  - npm run setup:mcp:windows (Windows)

  📁 Files Created:

  - scripts/setup-mcp.sh - Auto-install script for Unix systems
  - scripts/setup-mcp.ps1 - Auto-install script for Windows
  - .claude/mcp-setup-instructions.md - Complete setup documentation
  - Updated package.json with MCP setup commands
  - Updated .claude/CLAUDE.md with MCP server details

  🔄 How It Works:

  1. Run once: npm run setup:mcp installs all required MCP servers
  2. Automatic memory: I'll remember MCP availability through project memory
  3. Always available: MCP servers are globally installed and persist across sessions

  🎯 Next Steps:

  4. Run npm run setup:mcp (or Windows equivalent)
  5. Restart Claude Desktop
  6. Start any session with "Check project memory" and I'll automatically know all MCP tools are available        

  The system ensures I remember the MCP configuration and can use all research, memory, and development tools     
   consistently across sessions!
