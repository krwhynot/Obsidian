When planning an Azure project, selecting the right resources depends on your **business requirements**, **technical goals**, and **constraints**. Here's a practical guide to help you determine what Azure resources to use:

### ðŸ”¹ Step-by-Step Resource Planning Guide

#### 1. **Define the Project Scope**

- What problem are you solving?    
- Who are the users? (Internal, external, global?)    
- What are the expected usage patterns?
    

#### 2. **Identify Core Components**

Think in terms of layers:

- **Frontend** â€“ Web, mobile, desktop clients?    
- **Backend** â€“ APIs, business logic, integrations?    
- **Data** â€“ What data will be stored, and how?    
- **Networking & Security** â€“ Access control, VNETs, firewalls?    
- **Monitoring & Governance** â€“ How will you track usage, costs, and health?
    

#### 3. **Map to Azure Services**

|Need|Example Azure Services|
|---|---|
|Web/API Hosting|App Service, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure Functions|
|Data Storage|Azure SQL, Cosmos DB, Blob Storage, Azure Tables|
|Compute|Azure VMs, App Service, AKS, Azure Container Apps|
|Messaging/Integration|Azure Service Bus, Event Grid, Logic Apps|
|Identity & Access|Azure AD, Managed Identity, Key Vault|
|Monitoring|Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, Application Insights|
|DevOps & CI/CD|Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, ARM/Bicep, Terraform|
|Networking|Azure VNet, Application Gateway, Azure Firewall, Front Door|
|Security & Compliance|Defender for Cloud, Azure Policy, RBAC|

#### 4. **Non-Functional Requirements**

- **Availability**: SLAs, geo-redundancy
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling, load balancing    
- **Cost**: Estimate with [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/)    
- **Compliance/Security**: Industry standards (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.)
    

#### 5. **Reference Architectures**

Use [Microsoft's Azure Architecture Center](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/) for templates by workload:

- Web apps    
- Microservices    
- Data pipelines    
- IoT, AI/ML workloads
