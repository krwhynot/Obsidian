Coding Rules:
1. Write Code Like It’s Going to be Reviewed by Your Future Self
2. DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself), but Avoid “Magic”
3. Comment for the “Why,” Not the “What”
4. Single Responsibility Principle: Keep Functions Focused
5. Version Control is Not Optional (and Commit with Care)
6. Be Mindful of Dependencies
7. Refactor Regularly and Ruthlessly
8. Think in Systems, Not Just Code
9. Think Before You Code
10. Prioritize Small, Releasable Units

# Principles

1. DRY Principle
DRY: Don’t Repeat Yourself — A key tenet for reducing redundancy. If you find yourself replicating the same code block more than twice, it’s high time to think about abstraction.

2. KISS Principle
KISS: Keep It Simple, Stupid — Strive for simplicity in your code. For instance, if you’ve written a complex if-else chain, perhaps a switch statement or a dictionary would simplify and beautify the structure

3. SOLID Principles
SOLID is not a single principle but a collection of five design principles. Although they have their roots in object-oriented programming (OOP), their wisdom can be applied more broadly.

4. YAGNI Principle
YAGNI, “You Aren’t Gonna Need It,” warns against adding functionality until deemed necessary.

5. SoC Principle
SoC, or “Separation of Concerns,” suggests different areas of functionality should be managed by distinct and minimally overlapping modules.

6. LoD Principle
The Law of Demeter (LoD) is a guideline for developing software, particularly object-oriented programs. In its general form, the LoD is a specific case of loose coupling.

7. COI Principle
The Principle of Composition Over Inheritance (COI) suggests that it is more beneficial to use composition (combining simple objects to create more complex ones) over class inheritance.
