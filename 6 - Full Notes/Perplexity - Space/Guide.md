# Using Perplexity AI for GitHub-based React 19 Projects: Complete Guide

Thank you for being a Perplexity Pro subscriber! This comprehensive guide will show you how to leverage Perplexity's powerful features to streamline your GitHub-based coding project using React 19, Tremor Charts, Prisma ORM, SQL, and Azure.

## Setting Up a Perplexity Space for Your Coding Project

### Why Use Perplexity Spaces for Development

Perplexity Spaces are ideal for coding projects because they allow you to organize research, upload files, and maintain context across multiple development tasks [^1]. For a React 19 project with multiple technologies, a dedicated Space provides several key advantages:

- **Organized Knowledge Hub**: Keep all project-related threads grouped by topic or feature [^1]
- **File Upload Capabilities**: Upload and analyze code files, documentation, and configuration files up to 25MB each [^2]
- **Persistent Context**: Maintain conversation history and project context across sessions [^1]
- **Collaborative Features**: Share the Space with team members for collaborative development [^1]


### Step-by-Step Space Configuration

**1. Create Your Development Space**

- Navigate to "Spaces" in the left menu of Perplexity's interface [^1]
- Click "Create a Space" and enter a descriptive title like "React 19 Azure Project" [^1]
- Add a detailed description mentioning your tech stack: React 19, Tremor Charts, Prisma ORM, Azure SQL [^1]

**2. Configure Custom Instructions**

Set up specialized instructions for your coding context [^1]:

```
You are a senior full-stack developer expert specializing in:
- React 19 with latest features (Server Components, Actions API, new hooks)
- Tremor Charts for data visualization
- Prisma ORM with Azure SQL Database integration
- TypeScript best practices
- Azure cloud services and deployment

When reviewing code:
- Focus on React 19 best practices and new features
- Suggest performance optimizations

Provide step-by-step solutions with code examples when possible.
```

**3. Upload Project Files**

Upload key project files to establish context [^2]:

- `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
- Prisma schema files (`schema.prisma`)
- React component files
- Configuration files (`.env.example`, `tsconfig.json`)
- Documentation and README files
- Recent error logs or build outputs


## Reading and Analyzing Updated Repository Files

### File Upload Strategy

**Supported File Types for Code Analysis**

Perplexity Pro supports unlimited daily file uploads with advanced model analysis [^2]:

- **Code Files**: All major programming language files
- **Documentation**: PDFs, markdown files, and plain text
- **Configuration**: YAML, XML, and other config formats

**Best Practices for Repository Analysis**

1. **Batch Upload Related Files**: Upload files in logical groups (components, utilities, configurations) [^2]
2. **Include Context Files**: Always upload `package.json`, README, and configuration files first [^2]
3. **Use Descriptive Queries**: Ask specific questions about code structure, dependencies, or implementation patterns

### Effective Code Review Queries

**Architecture Analysis**

```
Analyze the uploaded React 19 components and suggest improvements for:
- Server Component optimization
- State management patterns
- Component composition
- TypeScript interface design
```

**Dependency Review**

```
Review the package.json and identify:
- Outdated dependencies that need updating
- Potential security vulnerabilities
- Compatibility issues with React 19
- Optimization opportunities
```


## Planning Architecture with React 19 and Modern Stack

### Leveraging React 19 Features

React 19 introduces several performance and developer experience improvements that are crucial for modern applications [^3][^4]:

**Server Components Implementation**

- Server Components enable server-side rendering with minimal JavaScript sent to clients [^3]
- Ideal for dashboard applications using Tremor Charts where initial data can be pre-rendered [^3]
- Improves SEO and initial page load performance significantly [^4]

**Actions API Integration**

- Simplifies asynchronous operations like form submissions and API calls [^5]
- Automatically handles pending states and error boundaries [^5]
- Perfect for Prisma ORM database operations with built-in loading states [^5]

**New Hooks and Performance**

- `useOptimistic` for immediate UI updates before server confirmation [^5]
- Enhanced `useFormStatus` for better form management [^4]
- Reduced need for `useMemo` and `useCallback` with the new React Compiler [^4]


### Architecture Planning Queries

Use these specific prompts in your Perplexity Space:

**Database Architecture**

```
Design a Prisma schema for [your project description] using Azure SQL Database with:
- Proper indexing strategies
- Relationship management
- Type safety with TypeScript
- Connection pooling optimization
```

**Component Architecture**

```
Plan a React 19 component hierarchy for a dashboard using Tremor Charts that includes:
- Server Components for data fetching
- Client Components for interactivity
- Proper state management
- Error boundary implementation
```


## Troubleshooting Bugs and Issues

### Common Integration Challenges

**Azure SQL Database + Prisma Connection Issues**

The most frequent problems involve connection string configuration [^6][^7]:

1. **Connection String Format**: Use proper JDBC format for Azure SQL [^7]
```
sqlserver://HOST[:PORT];database=DATABASE;user=USER;password=PASSWORD;encrypt=true
```

2. **Special Character Escaping**: Escape special characters in connection strings using curly braces [^7]
```
sqlserver://HOST[:PORT];database=DATABASE;user={MyServer/MyUser};password={ThisIsA:SecurePassword;};encrypt=true
```

3. **Environment Variables**: Ensure proper `.env` configuration with Prisma [^6]

**React 19 + Tremor Charts Integration**

Common issues and solutions [^8][^9]:

- **Bundle Size Optimization**: Tremor Charts work well with React 19's automatic optimization features
