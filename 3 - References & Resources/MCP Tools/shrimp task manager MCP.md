## **When Task Manager Excels for Error Resolution**

### **Complex Integration Errors**

**Example Scenario:** Your Azure Wordle frontend can't connect to the backend API

```
‚ùå Simple approach: "Fix API connection error"
‚úÖ Task Manager prompt: "My React frontend is getting CORS errors and 404s when calling Azure Functions. I need to systematically debug the connection between frontend (port 3000), Azure Functions, and Cosmos DB. This involves checking CORS configuration, API routes, authentication, network policies, and deployment settings across multiple Azure services."
```

### **Performance Issues Requiring Investigation**

**Example Scenario:** Your CRM system becomes slow with large datasets

```
‚úÖ Task Manager prompt: "The CRM performance degrades significantly with 1000+ organizations. I need to systematically identify bottlenecks across the React frontend, API calls, database queries, and Azure infrastructure. This requires profiling, optimization, and testing at each layer."
```

### **Architectural Problems**

**Example Scenario:** Your Wordle game state management is buggy

```
‚úÖ Task Manager prompt: "The game state in my Wordle app has race conditions and inconsistent updates between GameContext, localStorage, and API calls. I need to systematically refactor the state management architecture, ensuring proper data flow and preventing conflicts."
```

---

## **When NOT to Use Task Manager**

### **Simple Syntax/Logic Errors**

```
‚ùå Don't use for: "Fix this TypeScript error" or "Why is this function returning undefined?"
‚úÖ Use instead: Direct coding assistance or sequential thinking
```

### **Quick Bug Fixes**

```
‚ùå Don't use for: Single-line changes, obvious typos, missing imports
‚úÖ Use instead: Immediate code editing
```

---

## **Real Examples from Your Projects**

### **Azure Wordle Backend Issues**

```
"My Wordle frontend works perfectly but the backend is completely missing. When I try to integrate, I'm getting multiple errors: no API endpoints, missing Cosmos DB connection, session management not implemented, and word dictionary not loading. I need to systematically build and debug the entire backend integration while ensuring the frontend continues working."
```

### **CRM Excel Import Problems**

```
"The bulk Excel import feature is failing with various data format issues, duplicate detection problems, and database constraint violations. I need to systematically debug the import pipeline: file parsing, data validation, deduplication logic, database operations, and error handling for hundreds of records."
```

### **HungerRush Integration Debugging**

```
"The KDS display configuration isn't working as expected - orders aren't bumping independently, the Monitor Item Display isn't graying out correctly, and the Priority Order Type isn't highlighting To Go orders. I need to systematically debug the multi-display setup, event sequencing, and order type handling."
```
