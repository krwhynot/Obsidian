# Workflow: Incremental, Top-Down Implementation

<!--
This workflow breaks development into vertical slices. Each feature is developed and tested end-to-end.
It is copy-ready and compliant with your `.windsurf/workflows/` requirements.
-->

## Description

Implement project features one slice at a time — from UI to backend — while continuously documenting progress and validating output.

---

## Steps

1. **Select a Feature Slice**
   - Choose one vertical feature (e.g. authentication, dashboard).
   - Add a feature context summary in markdown.

2. **Provide Requirements to AI**
   - Supply relevant background and standards from planning phase.
   - Include diagrams or interface expectations if needed.

3. **Generate Code**
   - Use AI to draft full implementation for the selected slice.
   - Output must be testable and self-contained.

4. **Review and Test**
   - Manually test code.
   - If bugs or issues arise, prompt AI for fixes or make edits.

5. **Document the Feature**
   - Update markdown documentation with:
     - Feature description
     - Dependencies
     - How to test

6. **Repeat for Next Slice**
   - Once stable, move to the next feature slice.
