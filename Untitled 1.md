# How to Set Up Your Obsidian Vibe Coding Claude Project

## Step 1: Create New Project in Claude

1. Go to Claude.ai
2. Click "Projects" in the sidebar
3. Click "Create project"
4. Name it: "Obsidian Note System for Vibe Coding"

## Step 2: Add Project Knowledge

Upload these documents to your project in this order:

### Essential Documents (Upload First)

1. **Claude Project Brief** - The concise overview
2. **Claude Custom Instructions** - How Claude should help
3. **README - Obsidian Vibe Coding Setup** - Your main system documentation

### Reference Documents (Upload Next)

4. **Knowledge Base** - Detailed system reference
5. **Quick Setup Guide** - Implementation instructions
6. **All Template Files** - Your actual templates

## Step 3: Set Project Instructions

In the "Project instructions" field, paste:

```
You are helping optimize an Obsidian note-taking system for "vibe coding" - an intuitive development approach. The user has an existing folder structure that should be enhanced, not rebuilt.

Key principles:
- Zero-friction capture during creative flow
- Clear evolution path: Daily → Rough → Full → Snippet  
- "Current Focus" files to preserve context
- Technology-first tagging (#react, #typescript, etc.)

Always:
1. Work within their existing structure
2. Prioritize capture speed over perfect organization
3. Suggest incremental improvements
4. Provide actual template examples
5. Respect the creative "vibe" - flexibility over rigid rules

The goal is a system that's invisible during coding but powerful during retrieval.
```

## Step 4: Add Example Prompts

Save these as conversation starters:

1. "Help me set up the Daily Note and Current Focus templates"
2. "How should I organize React hooks and patterns I discover?"
3. "Create a custom template for debugging sessions"
4. "My process queue is getting too long - how do I optimize?"
5. "Show me Dataview queries for tracking concept evolution"

## Step 5: First Conversation

Start your first chat with:

```
I have an existing Obsidian vault with this structure:
- 1 - Rough Notes
- 2 - Source Material  
- 3 - References & Resources
- 5 - Templates
- 6 - Full Notes
- 7 - Projects
- Daily Notes

I want to optimize it for capturing coding concepts during creative flow. Where should I start?
```

## What This Project Gives You

### Consistent Help

## Tips for Using the Project

1. **Start conversations with context**: "I'm working on my Kitchen Pantry CRM project..."
2. **Share what's working/not working**: "The Daily Note is great but..."
3. **Ask for incremental improvements**: "What's one thing I could add this week?"
4. **Save successful customizations**: Add them to project knowledge

## Future Enhancements
